        "content": "I'm currently hard at work on the next major update for Benji; Version 1.2!\nWhat I've planned for this update is a big amount of new paths to diversify the player experience. I'm getting lots of great feedback from 1.1.x, but after a while it feels a bit repetitive, even with the variety of paths Benji! already has.\nAnother thing that's planned for Version 1.2 is a brand new Butterfly type; the Multiplier Butterfly. This Butterfly will work differently than the others, where you have to chase it down in order to get the multiplying effect on the pennies you picked up that round!\nThis update is going to be the foundation of the update I will work on next, which revolves around the story of Benji, with a list of levels to pick from and complete. Think of games where you can get a 1, 2 or 3-star rating per level as an example :)",
