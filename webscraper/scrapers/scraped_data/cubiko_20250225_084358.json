        "content": "Hi friends,\nWe wanted to share two important updates with you:\n1. Dust Shoe Installation Guide \nWe've noticed that many of you are curious about how to properly install and use the dust shoe. To help ensure you get the best experience with your Cubiko, we‚Äôve put together a step-by-step guide for installation.\nDue to the height limitation, installing the dust shoe requires removing the enclosure cover. Here are the detailed steps for proper installation:\nStep 1: Remove the Enclosure Cover\nTake off the enclosure cover from Cubiko to prepare for the installation.\nStep 2: Install the Top Cover\nInstall the Top Cover of the dust shoe on the spindle with 2 pieces of M4 x 8 screws.\nStep 3: Install the Lower Chamber\nAlign the magnet at the top of the Lower Chamber with the magnet on the Top Cover. The Lower Chamber is then connected to the Top Cover of the dust shoe. \nStep 4: Install the Vacuum Cleaner Tube\nInsert the Vacuum Cleaner Tube with 32mm outer diameter into the tube  connection of the dust shoe Top Cover. \nWe hope this guide helps you set up your dust shoe smoothly!\n2. Shipping Update \nWe regret to inform you that, after extensive discussions with our internal logistics team, we found that shipping costs to non-EU European countries and Middle Eastern regions are quite high. As a result, we will not be offering shipping to these areas during the Kickstarter campaign.\nHowever, if you are still interested in purchasing Cubiko after the campaign ends,  please visit our site https://www.sainsmart.com and reach out to us there for more details. \nIf you wish to purchase Cubiko now and need to inquire about shipping costs to your country, please contact our customer support at hello@sainsmart.com.\nWe apologize for any inconvenience this may cause and appreciate your understanding.\nThank you for your continued support!\nBest regards,\nSainSmart Team",

Dust Shoe Is Available Now\nWe‚Äôve heard your requests! Many of you have asked for a dust shoe to make cleaning easier, and we heard you! The dust shoe add-on is now available. Pair it with your Cubiko for an even better experience.\n2. About Pledging The Early Bird Tier\nWe‚Äôre truly grateful for your overwhelming support for Cubiko! Here‚Äôs a quick clarification for pledging the Early Bird Tier:\nQ: I didn‚Äôt pre-order. Can I still purchase an Early Bird tier? \nWhile pre-ordering offered priority access to these tiers, it didn‚Äôt guarantee a specific tier due to the nature of the Kickstarter platform.\nIf you didn‚Äôt pre-order, you‚Äôre still welcome to check out the available tiers and secure your spot! However, you won't receive the pre-order gift: Chromatic Coating End Mills (3PCS).\nThank you for your amazing support, and we appreciate your patience as we work to bring Cubiko to life! üöÄ\nShare Cubiko with your friends to earn 7% Cash Back!\nBest Regards,\nSainSmart Team",
