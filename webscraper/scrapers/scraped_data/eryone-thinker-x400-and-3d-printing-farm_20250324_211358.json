The Eryone X400 can undoubtedly bridge, at least in part, the gap between home and industrial printers, offering professionals with modest but regular production needs a new way of 3D printing. The next step, however, is to establish a network of reliable resellers, installers, trainers and local repair outlets, if this machine is to be a success in this market segment. The Eryone team knows it can already count on me.",
