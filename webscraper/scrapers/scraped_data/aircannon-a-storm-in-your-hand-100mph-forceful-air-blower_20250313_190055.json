Since we purchased the product from South Korea, we cannot be certain whether the same model is available in your country. In fact, our team also had faced the same difficulty as you did, since most of the anemometers could only indicate up to 100 mph. We believe that contacting local experts in your region may be the fastest way to confirm availability of similar unit. We’re truly sorry that we couldn’t be of more help, but we appreciate your understanding. Please feel free to reach out if there’s anything else we can assist you with! Best regards, Magpie Team",

Is it possible to just turn on your video and do a turbo continuous run and show that you actually can sustain turbo for 25 minutes as claimed? Even 10 minutes sustained would be persuasive. I would expect aa slight decline over the span but even that would be impressive. Some leaf blowers have huge decline in the first minute. Thanks.",

Despite any concerns you may have had, your trust and encouragement have been invaluable in ensuring the smooth progress of this project. Regarding Turbo Mode, we sincerely apologize for any confusion. It appears that you may have been referring to an old incorrect comment previously provided by a former customer service representative. While we did issue a correction in the comment section, we would like to clarify once again that Turbo Mode is designed to operate for approximately 12 seconds before automatically shutting off to prevent potential product overload. However, all other modes remain continuously operational! Before developing AirCannon, our team purchased and tested several air blowers from well-known competitors. Our tests revealed that, contrary to their stated specifications, all of them experienced a decline in airflow power within seconds including Turbo Mode. In contrast, AirCannon maintains its maximum power consistently, ensuring superior performance. Thank you very much for your support! Best Regards, Magpie Team",

It’s because of your support that we were able to get this project off the ground. We are truly grateful!\n🚀 [100% Goal Achieved in 5 Minutes!]\nThanks to all of you, we were able to reach our goal in no time! To achieve the funding goal in just 5 minutes is truly the moment we’ve been hoping for. Your interest and love have been a huge help. We sincerely thank you, and we will continue to strive to bring you more great news!\n💨 [Performance Revealed!] AirCannon Spec Test\nThe time has come to show you the powerful performance of the AirCannon that you’ve been eagerly waiting for! We’re sharing the actual test scenes of the specifications introduced in our Kickstarter product story. You’ll be able to see for yourself just how powerful the AirCannon is. \n1.Wind Speed Test🌪\nThe measurement unit is km/h\nWe used a professional anemometer to measure the wind speed generated by the AirCannon. The result was over 124mph (200km/h). It’s incredibly powerful, right?\n2.Wind Strength Test💪\nThe measurement unit is gram\nTo accurately measure the strength of the wind, we directed it at a precision scale and converted the wind force into weight. The result was an impressive 1.3kg (2.8lb) of wind. Once you experience this powerful wind firsthand, you’ll understand how amazing it is.\n🎁 [Unlock the $100,000 Stretch Goal!]-Special Gift Incoming!\nHere’s even more exciting news! We’ve prepared a special stretch goal for this project. If the total funding reaches $100,000, we’ll give all backers a special gift as a thank-you! What the gift will be will be revealed once the goal is achieved. So, please let your friends know and join in! The more people who join, the sooner we’ll reach the goal!\nOnce again, thank you so much for your support! If you have any questions, feel free to reach out to us anytime at info@magpie-tech.com.
