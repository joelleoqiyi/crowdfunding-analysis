            "text": "Regarding the product introduction, TappTec is powerful enough to cover all of my needs during daily work on construction sites. I would like to focus more on understanding its software solution behavior. If you could take a look at the app called \"magicplan\": https://www.magicplan.app/, you notice that they are offering the measurement and documents management features via LIDAR camera and smart phone/pad HW, which helps me a lot, if TappTec can be integrated into the app, it will be awesome. What's more I am also seeking for some cheap tool which can support on-site layout feature i.e. Leica ICON ics20/ics50, Trimble Ri and other total station could offer. maybe that could be the direction for your next step. thanks.",
