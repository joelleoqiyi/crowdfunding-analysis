In the survey, you can provide your shipping address phone number, and pay shipping costs which are essential for smooth delivery.\nThe shipping cost for backers in the United States will increase by $3 higher than expected due to the latest tariff policy. We have tried our best to control the cost of transportation. Thank you for your understanding!\nPlease take a moment to check your email and fill out the survey as soon as possible to avoid any delays. We prepare some add-ons at discount rates for our backers, feel free to check them out.\nFor any questions or concerns, feel free to contact us at Kickstarter. Thanks again for your support ‚Äì we‚Äôre looking forward to delivering your rewards soon!\nBest regards,\nVitaLink Team",
