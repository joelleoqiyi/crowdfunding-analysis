        "content": "Hi Guys!\nWe are very excited to announce that our Memdock Gen2 Kickstarter campaign has reached a successful conclusion! We sincerely thank all of our backers for their trust and enthusiasm. Your support has made this project possible. Without your help, we would not be able to get to this point today.\nIn the past few weeks, we have worked closely with the manufacturing team to develop a detailed production plan and ensure that every step is progressing as planned. To keep everyone better informed of the latest progress, we will post regular updates on the project.\nNext steps:\nIn order to ship smoothly, we will send a questionnaire containing an email to collect the mailing address of each backer and calculate the corresponding shipping costs. Please note that the survey email will be sent after about a week. Please fill it out in time to avoid delays in shipping.\nAbout payment issues:\nWe have also noticed that some backers may have failed to charge their credit cards. If your payment is not successful, please update your payment information as soon as possible. You can click on this link to see how to change your payment method:\n\nhttps://help.kickstarter.com/hc/en-us/articles/115005132933-How-can-I-change-my-payment-method-before-funding-ends\nUpdate the payment method. Please make sure your payment is completed before the deadline to avoid missing your reward.\nWe are making final preparations for shipping and look forward to getting the product to you as soon as possible!
