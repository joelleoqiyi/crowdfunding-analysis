Initially, it’ll be in English only, with plans for a multi-language update (v1.0.1) shortly after. If you haven’t joined us yet, now’s the perfect time—secure our annual membership for just $1 (normally $39.99), with only 41 spots remaining. Plus, the first 100 angel users can suggest custom features to be added in future versions. Thank you for your incredible support!",
