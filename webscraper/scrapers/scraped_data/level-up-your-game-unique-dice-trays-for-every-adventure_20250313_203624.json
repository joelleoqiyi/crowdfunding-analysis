We still have over a week to go, so please do me a favor and share this campaign with your friends, family, and complete strangers.\nLogistics wise, I'm hoping to get the backer surveys out as soon as I can once the campaign ends. Those who are getting the digital files should get them pretty fast, and those who are ordering physical trays shouldn't be far behind.\nOnce again, thank you all for joining me on this journey. Please don't hesitate to comment or message me if you have any questions. \nSteve",
