        "content": "Hello, backers!\nLast week, we hosted a closed gathering where we unveiled the UCC3 and held a public test party! 🎉\nEven among attendees who already owned the UCC2, many were impressed by the detailed information display of the UCC3.\nPlus, the ability to test USB ports was a huge surprise that received lots of praise!\nEveryone eagerly brought their own devices and cables to test, making for a fun and engaging event.\nOur creator, Aloe-san, was also there and managed to spot a few minor bugs and areas for improvement.\n\nWe found some bad cables.\n↓ ex) Cables connecter indicate \"100W\" but actually PD PowerCAP is 60W\n（↑こちらはテスト会で発見されたダメなケーブルの例、コネクタに100Wと書いているのに実際には60Wが限界でした）\n\n\nバッカーの皆さんこんにちは！ \n\n先週、クローズドな集まりながら、UCC3のお披露目とパブリックテストを兼ねたパーティを実施しました！ \n既にUCC2はみんな所持しているような参加者たちでも、UCC3の詳細な情報表示には感銘を受けてくれたご様子。\n 更に、USBポートのチェックもできることには改めて驚きと称賛を頂きました。 \n早速みんなが持ち寄ったデバイスやケーブルをチェックし、楽しい会となりました。 \n製作者のあろえさんも参加し、いくつかの軽微なバグや改善点を見つけたとのこと。 \n\n今後も同じような催しができればと考えています！",
