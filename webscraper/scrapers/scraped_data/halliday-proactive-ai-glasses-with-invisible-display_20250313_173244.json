        "content": "Dear All Backers,\nWe are thrilled to announce that Halliday's campaign on Kickstarter has successfully concluded. We are incredibly proud to say that we have become the most funded smart glasses to date, raising over $3,200,000 with more than 8,000 backers. This achievement would not have been possible without your enthusiastic support and unwavering belief in our vision.\nOver the 45-day campaign, we received an overwhelming amount of positive feedback and valuable insights from our backers. We will carefully review all the feedback we receive and incorporate it into our ongoing product improvements. Your input is invaluable to us as we continue to refine and perfect Halliday for all of you.\n    What's Next?\nLet's go over the next steps for:\nPayment process\nCollections of shipping addresses, lenses preference, prescription details, ring sizes, and frame colors\nDeposit refund process\nBe sure to read the details below carefully—this information is important!\nPayment Collection Process\nOn the first 7 days after the campaign ends, Kickstarter will start processing all backers' payments.\nIn this period, Kickstarter will automatically collect payment from the bank account you provided when you backed our product. Here is an overview of the steps Kickstarter will take:\nIf a pledge fails to collect, Kickstarter will send backers periodic email reminders in the next 7 days, and display an \"Action Needed\" banner when you log into the Kickstarter account from which you pledged. Follow the instructions in either the Kickstarter email or notification banner to resolve your payment issues:\nCheck that you've entered a valid credit card number and the correct expiration date.\nMake sure the card has not expired.\nConfirm that your billing information is correct.\nMake sure you haven't exceeded the credit limit on your card.\nIf everything checks out and your pledge still can't be processed, it's possible that your bank put a hold on the charge. Sometimes, banks will decline charges if they don't align with a cardholder's regular spending patterns. Therefore, as a final resort, you may need to contact your bank to request the bank process this charge. If you have contacted the bank and the issue remains unresolved, feel free to reach out to the Kickstarter support team at www.kickstarter.com/contact.com. Or you can also contact our customer service team at support@hallidayglobal.com.\n  Collections of Shipping Addresses, Lenses Preferences, Prescription Details, Ring Sizes, and Frame Colors\nAfter Kickstarter successfully processes your payment, we will send you a survey to confirm your shipping addresses, lens preferences, prescription details, ring sizes, and frame colors. We expect to begin sending these surveys in the third week following the campaign's conclusion.\nBelow are some things you may need to prepare in advance or pay attention to:\n1. Lenses Options：\nWe offer a variety of lenses to meet your needs, including plano lenses, standard prescription lenses, photochromic non-prescription lenses, photochromic prescription lenses, progressive prescription lenses, and non-prescription sunglasses.\nIf you prefer to install the lenses yourself, you can choose the plano option and take your Halliday glasses to any optical store for a custom fitting. Since Halliday doesn't rely on lenses for content projection, it is fully compatible with all types of lenses.\n  2. Prescription Details Collection:\nWe must collect the Sphere, Cylinder, Axis, ADD(for progressive lenses), and PD (Pupillary Distance) for both your left and right eyes. Please have this information ready in advance.\nHow to Obtain Your PD?\nYour Pupillary Distance (PD) is the distance in millimeters (mm) between the centers of your pupils. \nWe recommend visiting an optical store to have a professional optician measure it for you. \nHowever, if you prefer to measure it yourself, you can follow these simple steps:\nGrab a small ruler in one hand and have your pencil and paper handy.\nNow, position yourself approximately 8 inches (20 cm) away from a mirror.\nClose your left eye and align the 0 mm over the center of your right pupil.\nMeasure the distance from your right to your left pupil.\nThe number that lines up directly over your left pupil is your PD (an average PD for an adult ranges between 58 and 65).\n3. Ring Size Collection:\nWe offer a wide range of US ring sizes to meet different needs. If you're unsure about your ring size, here are some ring-size measurement apps we recommend. You can download them to measure your finger and estimate your ring size.\n  4. Frame Options:\nHalliday Glasses come in three colors: Black, Gradient, and Tortoiseshell. You can also let us know your preference in the survey.\nPlease pay attention to your Kickstarter message box and the email associated with your pledge. To help us start the delivery quickly, please fill out the survey as soon as you receive it.\n  Deposit Refund for Backers Who Reserved Launch Day Offer\nFor backers who paid the $9.9 deposit before the campaign was launched on Kickstarter, we'll refund you the $39.9 ($9.9 deposit + $30 discount). Once Kickstarter successfully collects your payment (which occurs within the first 7 days after the campaign ends), we will initiate the refund within 14 working days after we successfully receive your payment.\nRefund Amount and Accounts\nThe $9.9 deposit will be refunded to the payment account that you used to place the deposit.\nThe $30 discount will be refunded back to the account you used for pledging on Kickstarter. (Please be aware that the refund process may take up to 30 days to complete, following platform regulations.)\n*NOTE: We will cross-match the backers' email list with the deposit buyers' email list to identify backers who applied for a deposit. If you find that you used a different email address than the one provided for the deposit when backing the campaign, please feel free to contact us at support@hallidayglobal.com.\n  Once again, thank you all for making this historic moment possible. We look forward to delivering an exceptional experience with Halliday, and we promise to keep you updated every step of the way.\nWith Love,\nThe Halliday Team",

Your trust and support continuously motivate us to keep moving forward. We've been working around the clock on various fronts, from product production to software development, and we're excited to share our progress with you!\n  First Batch Production and Reliability Testing\nCurrently, we have completed the material preparation for the first batch of mass production and have conducted a small-scale production run.\nAt this stage, we are carrying out extensive reliability tests, including rolling tests, drop tests, waterproof tests, constant temperature and humidity tests, high and low-temperature tests, and vibration tests, among others. We will continue to optimize our product based on the feedback from these tests. This will help us gradually ramp up our capacity and ensure a seamless production flow. Check out the images below for a sneak peek into our process!\nDemo Releases\nCurrently, the basic OS for Halliday Glasses is ready to go, and we're continuously refining our key features. We've been soaking up all your excitement and feedback about the demo videos! As our software keeps getting better and better, we are ready to roll it out! From the Proactive AI you've been dying to see to the everyday essentials like notification and music – they're all right here! Click the link below to dive into the demos!\nhttps://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1qTXkAZGXelYGGm9E4r5_FSrngOj_n7Nv?usp=drive_link\nAlso, stay tuned because we'll keep making more demo videos. Do you have something specific you want to see? Feel free to share it in the comments!\n  Crafting the Perfect User Experience\nWe want everything to feel fluid and seamless, so we've been pouring our hearts into refining the user experience. We're currently developing an engaging setup process, designing packaging, and creating easy-to-understand product manuals. Our goal is for you to feel excited and confident when your package arrives!\nOur UI designer has hand-drawn an initial draft of the setup process to give you a behind-the-scenes look. While it's still in the early stages, we can't wait to see how it evolves and hope you'll love the final result as much as we do!\n  We'll continue to update you on production developments and software progress, so stay tuned! If you have any questions or thoughts, please feel free to post them in the comments.

There has been very ambiguous feedback on whether there will be SDK integ. Also the replies on the lenses are ambiguous. No clear into the Halliday OS. I really need to know if this is actually worth the investment, when I know that 3 months down the line there could be a better version. Also, the subscription model, I would end up spending monthly quite a bit to make use of the features that are best for me, proactive ai and recording. Then there is the digiwindow, in these videos this does not look anything like what im expecting. I need strong proof these will be a game changer.",

Minimum would be speed and direction which could come from phone and not need integration with another app/device. Better would be data like battery %, voltage, duty cycle, speed etc. I currently use this app written for my Garmin watch, but having it’s in displayed in my glasses would be way cooler. https://blkfribourg.github.io/",

I have a request and a suggestion: Since your glasses do not come with a sunglasses clip, it would be fantastic if you could also offer an option for self-dimming lenses. I believe the technical term for this is \"photochromic,\" meaning that the lenses automatically darken when exposed to sunlight. This feature would greatly help many of us who wear glasses, as it would eliminate the need for a separate pair of sunglasses. Additionally, photochromic lenses are naturally a bit darker than regular lenses, which helps reduce glare when looking upward in a more subtle way. I assume it is still possible to add this option during production, since the correct lens number and color are determined later on. Thank you in advance for considering this suggestion.",

I’ve never backed anything on kickstarter so for me these were a must have, I already pay for prescribed glasses every two years so why not pay a little extra to have all of this on top, no brainer! Cheers, Scott",

Imagine being in a bustling café in Tokyo or a business meeting in Berlin, and suddenly language isn't a barrier anymore. The translation happens so naturally - it's like magic! The best part? It doesn't feel like you're using some complicated tech. These glasses look just like normal eyewear, but they're secretly breaking down communication walls. When someone speaks in another language, the translation just appears smoothly in your view. No awkward pauses, no fumbling with translation apps. As someone who's always been fascinated by languages but struggles with learning them, these glasses feel like a dream come true. They're not just a gadget; they're like a bridge connecting people from different cultures. And let's be real - the fact that they look stylish and offer prescription lenses? Total bonus! 🤓 It's like having a superpower that nobody can see. For someone who loves connecting with people and believes communication is the heart of human experience, the Halliday Glasses are nothing short of revolutionary. Can't wait to see how this technology evolves!",

I have made a deposit invoice number 10657 as well joined in on the funding by pledging and paying for soon one pair of glasses.. That confirmation order number is : ed71fa904a2485e4b14ce43095e7dcc6 I am all but excited about every aspect this device has to offer. If this device is fluid I will back it more than I'm able to say on this teeny thread. Peace be the journey.",
