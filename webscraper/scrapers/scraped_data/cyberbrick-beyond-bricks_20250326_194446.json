        "content": "$500,000 Funded & 8,000 Backers—You’re Changing the Game!\nFrom static prints to programmable, interactive creations, this community is proving that 3D printing’s future is alive with possibility. Thank you for making CyberBrick a movement!\n👕Early Bird Exclusive T-Shirts: A Token of Our Gratitude\nTo the visionary backers who joined us first: All the backers who got one of the Early Bird rewards are getting an exclusive CyberBrick T-shirt! This isn’t just merch—it’s a badge of honor for those who dared to reimagine what 3D printing could be. This is our way of rewarding your trust (and, admittedly, fast internet & a bit of luck). We're still working on the design and will reveal it later!\nHow It Works:\nAfter the campaign, you’ll receive a redeemable code to claim your shirt.\nChoose your size and shipping address later. Due to the size of the packages, the T-shirt may not be shipped together with your kit, so we will deliver the kits to your hands first.\n🥰 Stickers for Everyone: \nEvery single backer—yes, no matter when you joined —will get a set of MakerWorld x Bambu Lab stickers shipped with your kit. No extra steps are needed! Slap them on laptops, toolboxes, or your 3D Printed projects —let the world know you’re part of the revolution.\n🚀 What’s NEXT? Even Bigger Rewards Await! \nWe’re blown away by your support—but the journey doesn’t stop here! We’ll unleash something special to thank you all. Here’s what we’re exploring:\nPotential exclusive digital content: Think 3D-printable add-ons or behind-the-scene content\nSurprise bonus: backers could get an extra treat (we’re still brainstorming…) Mousepads? Badges? Tote Bags? Tell us what you like : )\nThis is YOUR campaign: The more we grow, the bigger we can dream together. Share now to help us decide!",

        "content": "Dear Creators and Backers,\nThank you for your incredible support! Many of you have expressed the desire to get started with designing as soon as possible, so we’ve quickly put together a set of foundational resources to help you dive in. This file package includes CAD models and basic specifications for all hardware modules, allowing you to at least begin your structural design work. We also encourage you to share these materials and invite more creators to join the CyberBrick community. Let’s build the future together！\nSome part names or descriptions in these preview materials are subject to change. However, the dimensions and CAD models provided are accurate. We appreciate your understanding, as these resources have been released ahead of our original schedule.\nOn the other hand, our apps are still undergoing user testing and certification, so they won’t be available for a little while. However, rest assured that all hardware wiring and channel mappings are adjustable, so you won’t need to worry about making major design changes later. Thank you for your understanding!\nIf you have any questions about these materials or need additional information, please reply at the Bambu Lab forum post, and we’ll respond as soon as possible. We also encourage you to exchange project ideas in the forum. You may find new inspirations from each other's projects, and avoid duplicate projects.\nFor questions about Kickstarter orders, pricing, and other related topics, please continue to interact in the Kickstarter comments section so that more people can benefit from the discussion.\nThank you for your support! Looking forward to your amazing projects!\nDownload the files here on Google Drive",

        "creator": "MakerWorld\nMarch 17, 2025",
        "date": "March 17, 2025",
        "content": "Dear Backers & Creators,\nThank you all for your incredible interest in CyberBrick!\nPreviously, we didn’t dive too deeply into the Time-lapse Kit to keep the focus on the RC-Toy as the central application example for CyberBrick. However, we’ve noticed some confusion about its compatibility and functionality, so here’s a detailed explanation:\nWhich printers are compatible with the Time-lapse Kit? Do I need to purchase a cable to connect it to my printer?\nThe Time-lapse Kit supports both the A series and the X/P series printers. It can be connected to your printer using either the 4-Pin AMS cable or the 6-Pin AMS cable. If you’re using an AMS, you can connect the Time-lapse Module to the AMS instead of directly to the printer.\nIf you already have the cable that came with your AMS and don’t need the AMS while taking your desired time-lapse, simply unplug the cable from the AMS and connect it to the Time-lapse Module. If you need to use the AMS at the same time, you can purchase additional cables from the Bambu Lab Store.\nWhat cameras are compatible with the Time-lapse kit?\nThe Time-lapse module provides 3 ways to work with a camera or phone:\nBluetooth\nFor smartphones and cameras with Bluetooth function, the module can connect to them like any other Bluetooth peripheral device. The onboard button can initiate Bluetooth pairing and the LED indicates connection status and notify trigger release.\n  Cable\nIf your camera requires an external Shutter Release Cable, you can find one with an AUX 2.5mm connector to connect it to the Time-lapse module, like the ones shown below:\nServo (Mechanical)\nIf your camera supports neither of the above, you can also connect a servo to the Time-lapse module and mechanically press the shutter release button on your camera.\nWhat role do the mobile app and Bambu Studio play?\nThe Time-lapse can pair with Bluetooth devices by pressing its built-in button, and it has LED to indicate the connection status and notify shutter trigger. Only if you need to fine-tune certain parameters, such as servo rotation angle, then you can use the mobile app.\n\nThe Bambu Studio lets you set the time-lapse mode on your printer so it will park the tool head at the corner after each layer and send a triggering signal to the Time-lapse module.\n\nFor more details on how to use them please kindly wait for the user instruction later.\nIn what ways is it better than the built-in Time-lapse function on my printer?\nThe image quality of your choice of camera should be better than the built-in camera, and you have more freedom in terms of where to place the camera, what angle to point at your print, etc. \nWhat additional parts do I need for it to work?\nApart from the AMS cable mentioned above, if your camera does not support Bluetooth and requires a cable to trigger the shutter, you will need to source the AUX 2.5mm cable yourself based on the model and brand of your camera.\nIf I already chose a pledge without the Time-lapse kit, how can I add it?\nYou can click on \"modify\" on your pledge's page. If you choose one of the RC vehicles as the \"base\" pledge, you can add the Time-lapse kit as an add-on. \nDoes the pledge reward include the 3D-Printed case?\nNo, the physical 3D printed case for the Time-lapse kit is not included in the reward. Basically we're assuming that if you are trying to take a 3D Printing time lapse, you have a 3D printer at hand : )",
