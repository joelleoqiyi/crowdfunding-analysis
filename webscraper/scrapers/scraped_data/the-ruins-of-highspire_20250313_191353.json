Here are the ones I have finished, although a couple still need to be test printed so may need changes.\nFirstly, due to my fdm printer having difficulty with a couple of the treasure chest designs, that stretch goal has been changed to include chests and barrels.\nHere are the rest of the competed designs.\nDoors\nWalls\nWall corner\nWalkway corner and wlakway floor tiles\nwalkway T section\nNext on the agenda are some more walkway pieces and another small tower, as well as a complete, unruined version, of the large tower.\nOkay, that's it for now.\nHave a great day\nNeil\nFoxCraft Creations",

This is the first in a series of ruins I plan on designing around the crumbling city of Highspire.\nThe campaign has started well and seven stretch goals have already been unlocked.\nI have the first three stretch goals up on the kickstarter page but you can also see them here:\nStretch Goal 1, two stone columns\nStretch Goal 2, treasure chests\nStretch Goal 3, ruined tower base\nI thought I had all three of there sets ready to go, but I've had some printing issues with the chests, so I'll be dropping the two with more ornate designs and replacing them with some barrels in various states of decay. I'll update the picture once that's done.\nIf we get to NZ$10,000 the rate of stretch goals will slow to one every two thousand dollars. \nOkay, I'll be back with more news as more things get unlocked and I finish up the designs.\nBest wishes,\nNeil\nFoxCraft Creations",
