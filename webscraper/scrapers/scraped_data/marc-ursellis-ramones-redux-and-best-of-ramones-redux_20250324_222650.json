That is one hell of a list of contributors, and I'm so glad to be involved, I was lucky enough to see The Ramones play live at The Cornwall Coliseum in St Austell, back in May of 1986, and they were pretty damn Awesome! I've always considered The Ramones as being the first proper Punk band in the world, they were about for some before the term Punk Rock was coined, but musically, they ere still Punk!!!",
