        "content": "We’ve received many inquiries about “what documents are needed for tax-exempt purchases”. In fact, businesses or organizations—whether in the EU, USA, or Canada—may qualify for reduced or even 0% tax simply by registering for the proper tax ID or providing proof of exemption. Below is a quick summary of key documentations in major regions, helping you prepare more efficiently and save on costs.\n    United States: Sales & Use Tax Exemption\nResale Certificate\nBusinesses purchasing goods for resale can present a valid seller’s permit and complete state-specific or streamlined exemption forms (e.g., CDTFA-230 or SSTGB Form F0003).\n  Tax-Exempt Organizations\n501(c)(3) nonprofits, schools, universities, government agencies, or tribal entities must provide documentation verifying their tax-exempt status (e.g., an IRS determination letter, state exemption certificate, or official purchase order).\n  EU Region: EU VAT Exemption\nValid EU VAT ID or Local Business Registration Number\nProvide a valid EU VAT number (verified via the EU VIES system) or a local business registration number (e.g., SIRET, NIF) accepted in certain jurisdictions.\nIn many cases, an EU VAT ID is required for cross-border B2B transactions, while some member states may allow their local tax or business IDs for domestic purchases.\nOther Tax-Exempt Organizations\nNonprofits, NGOs, educational institutions, or governmental bodies may be eligible to furnish recognized proof of tax-exempt status (such as official registration documents or tax-exempt certificates) to potentially enjoy 0% VAT, subject to local regulations.\n  Canada: GST/HST/PST Relief\nRegistered Charities (BN) / Public Service Bodies\nSubmit relevant certificates to apply for tax exemption or reduction, such as a charity registration number, government bodies, schools, or universities typically need to provide official purchase orders or exemption documentation.\nFirst Nations Purchasers\nPossess recognized identification from the government (e.g., Indian band or band-empowered entity) to qualify for specific 0% tax rates or exemptions.\n        Disclaimer\nThe above information is provided for general reference only and does not constitute legal or tax advice. Tax rates, regulations, and eligibility criteria may vary or change across countries (and within states or provinces). If you have questions, please consult a local tax advisor or the official tax authority to ensure compliance and obtain accurate details on tax exemptions.\nIf you or your organization meet any of the above criteria, we recommend verifying your eligibility and registering for a tax ID or applying for a tax-exempt certificate with the relevant authorities as soon as possible. This way, you can immediately benefit from tax savings on your next purchase and effectively reduce procurement costs! Should you have any further questions, feel free to contact us. We wish you continued success and look forward to providing even better service.",
