If you're concerned that you missed it, feel free to check your private messages on Kickstarter, the link is waiting for you there!\nThe new project of BloomFab, HydroGen 1.0 is coming!\nMore details about the HydroGen 1.0 HERE!\nBehind this intriguing name hides a complete starter kit for hydroponic enthusiasts!\nGrow your own salads (or any other plants suited to the Kratky method) without the need for electricity!\nThere are plenty of YouTube tutorials on starting a hydroponic farm, but most require tools and a fair amount of skill. While they certainly work, the results often lack aesthetic appeal.\nHydroGen 1.0 bridges the gap by combining the precision of 3D printing (for both function and aesthetics) with the simplest hydroponic method, perfect for beginners!\nWe're launching on Tuesday, so feel free to follow the launch! Even if hydroponics isn't your thing, we're giving away a free STL for your garden for the first time! ðŸŒ±\nHere is the link: https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/bloomfab/hydrogen-3d-your-3d-printed-mini-hydroponic-farm \nBloomFab",

We also added another style for the first hydropot!\nHere is a preview of the extra stretch goal from the first project we just unlocked together:\nAbout delivery\nIf you came from the first project, you know how fast we deliver. You'll will receive all of the STLs, directly in your Kickstarter inbox in a day or two.\n\nNote: Some people have some trouble with their payment. If it's your case try to fix it as soon as possible, you'll not receive your pledges before the problem is solved on your side ;)\nThank you so much for your support on that new project!!\nBloomFab",
