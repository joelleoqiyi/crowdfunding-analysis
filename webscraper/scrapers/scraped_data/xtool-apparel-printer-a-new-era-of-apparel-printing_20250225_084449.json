        "content": "Hi Backers,\n  Your incredible support has propelled the xTool Apparel Printer to new heights, and we're thrilled to unveil our first stretch goal at the $2.5 million milestone‚Äîa CMYKW ink set (five bottles, 500ml each) and 25 meters of film roll for every backer! \nOur ink uses high-quality Japanese imported resin, enhancing ink flow and reducing printhead clogging, thereby extending the lifespan of the printhead. Additionally, it improves the stretchability of printed patterns on fabrics, making your apparel durable and long-lasting. \n  Moreover, our ink and film are OEKO-TEX certified, meeting ecological and health standards. This means they are safe for people and the environment, and have no harmful effects for direct skin contact.\nCurious about the exciting gifts awaiting us at the next stretch goal? Help us reach $2.5 million to uncover the surprise!\n  Sincerely,\nxTool Team",

A stretch goal is a traditional Kickstarter activity: If the campaign's total sales reach a specified target, all backers receive an additional gifts. Our first stretch goal target is $2.5 million.
