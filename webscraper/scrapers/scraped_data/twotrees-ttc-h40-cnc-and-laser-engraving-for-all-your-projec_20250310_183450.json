        "content": "Hey TwoTrees Backers,\nA huge THANK YOU for your incredible support! We‚Äôve been closely following all your comments and feedback, and we truly appreciate every bit of it. International shipping, especially for a solid machine like the TTC-H40/H80, is no small feat, but we‚Äôre committed to making things easier for you. So, to show our gratitude and make things a little easier for you, we‚Äôve decided to cover part of the shipping costs, reducing rates by over 30%! üéâüì¶\nWe‚Äôve updated the shipping rates for many regions, and the savings are significant. If your country isn‚Äôt listed in the table, don‚Äôt worry‚Äîjust send us a message, and we‚Äôll work out the best solution for you. (The shipping estimates are calculated in USD.)\nWe explored several shipping options, including FedEx, but honestly, the prices were outrageous‚Äîalmost $1,600 to ship to the U.S.! Clearly, that wasn‚Äôt going to be a reasonable choice for most backers.\nHere‚Äôs a breakdown using the TTC-H80 Advanced package as an example: \n‚úÖ Total weight (including machine & accessories): 80KG\n‚úÖ Box dimensions: 238.5 √ó 43 √ó 30.5 cm\nTo bring costs down while ensuring safe and timely delivery, we‚Äôve opted for a sea freight + local distribution approach. Why?\n‚úÖ Much lower overall shipping costs compared to express options like FedEx/DHL\n‚úÖ Reduced taxes in some countries thanks to import processing at the warehouse\nWe know that every dollar counts, and we‚Äôre committed to making this campaign as accessible as possible. While we can‚Äôt eliminate shipping costs entirely, we‚Äôre doing everything we can to minimize the financial burden while ensuring your machine arrives safely and on time.\nIf you have any questions about shipping to your country, or if your country isn‚Äôt listed in our table, just reach out! We‚Äôll do our best to find a solution.\nOnce again, we can't thank you enough for your unwavering support, patience, and trust in us.\nCheers,\nTwoTrees Team",

That was what pushed me forward to purchase this cnc over other cnc's. Features, quality, price, and after purchase customer support. I am definitely anxious to get started with this step up in my cnc experience. I'm sure there will be many others who feel as I do about this machine and Twotrees.",

For me and my need the best choice. Okey ttc hasen‚Äòt the big Community with help with Things and do. But it shine i‚Äôts a exciting CNC, so I‚Äòm thinking it‚Äòs sure to get a big Community for this wonderfull CNC! Big, but you can it dissamble in a small Package when not in use. Stable yet slim.
