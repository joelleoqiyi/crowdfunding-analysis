        "content": "Dear Genmitsu Cubiko backers,\nOur Kickstarter campaign has officially come to an end with $1,245,221 funded and 3,222 backers. THANK YOU SO MUCH for your incredible support! Your belief in Cubiko has brought this project to life, and we couldn‚Äôt have done it without you.\nWhat‚Äôs Next?\nNow, we shift our focus to the next phase: final testing, manufacturing preparations, and compliance processes. Everything is on track, and we will be following our timeline to ensure smooth progress towards shipping.\n1. Survey & VAT/Taxes\nWe will send out a survey via PledgeBox soon to collect your shipping address and VAT/Taxes. The survey is expected to be sent 14 days after the campaign ends, following Kickstarter's standard payment process. We will also post an update to remind everyone when it‚Äôs time to fill it out.\n2. SEB Refund Process\nFor those who pre-ordered with a $1 deposit and hold a pre-order number between No.1-1000, if you did not get a Super Early Bird tier but instead backed the Early Bird tier, you can contact us hello@sainsmart.com for a $50 refund.\n‚ö†Ô∏è Important Note: Please contact us as soon as possible. Refunds are scheduled to begin one week after the campaign ends.\nüì© Email Format:\nSubject: Cubiko Pre-order Refund Application | Pre-order No. xxx\nTo: hello@sainsmart.com\nInclude in your email:\n\n1. Pre-order email address\n2. Pre-order number (No.1-No.1000) (Check it here)\n3. Pledge details: Backer number (# xxx) & Kickstarter order email address\n3. See the Cubiko Prototype in Action at NHS 2025!\nWe know many of you are eager to see Cubiko in action, and we‚Äôre excited to invite you to the National Hardware Show 2025! Visit us at Booth #W4230 to witness Cubiko‚Äôs capabilities firsthand and share your thoughts with us.\nRegister: http://nvyt.es/6552c01d8716f1b18aad\nDate: March 18-20, 2025\nLocation: Las Vegas Convention Center (West Hall)\nWe‚Äôd love to meet you there!\n4. Samples Arrived!\nOur new sample units have arrived and entered the rigorous testing phase! üîç We plan to expand evaluations by sending units to additional third-party reviewers. üåü\nStay tuned for comprehensive insights coming your way! üì¢\n5. Kickstarter Q & A\nA) When will my card be charged? What should I do, if my Payment fails?\nKickstarter will begin collecting pledges straight away. If there's a problem charging your card, you'll have 7 days from the end of the campaign to address the issue.\nThe following are several reasons that could have caused the payment to fail. Please refer to the below information as guidance to fix it:\n1. Make sure that there are sufficient resources in your bank account, and that the payment does not exceed your online payment limits. Check it directly in your online banking or call your bank for help.\n2. During the charging period, the bank or card issuer may call you to confirm the payment. Please make sure that your phone is on all the time.\n3. If your credit card linked with the Kickstarter account expires or is not available anymore, you can change the PAYMENT method on KICKSTARTER.\nInstructions:\nThis will be a matter of logging in to your Kickstarter account and clicking \"Fix Payment\" at the top of the page. Or click \"Retry your payment\" and click \"Add a new card\" on the page of the errored pledge, fill up the information of an available card and agreement, click \"Fix payment\"\n4.  If the credit card is correct and valid but the payment still fails, you can follow the KS tutorial to communicate with the bank directly in order to solve this issue and prepare the necessary information. Kickstarter Support\n5.  If all the above failed, you can always feel free to contact us at hello@sainsmart.com and we will help you through it.\nB) When and how will my shipping address be collected?\nWe will send out a survey via PledgeBox soon to collect your address. The survey will normally be sent to your Kickstarter email address 14 days after the campaign ends according to Kickstarter's payment process routine. And don‚Äôt worry we will remind you by posting an update on Kickstarter.\nC) When will the shipping begin?\nWe expect to complete production around May 2025 and will begin preparing for shipment afterward. We will keep you updated on the progress and notify you once shipping arrangements are finalized.\nDue to the delays with international logistics, the arrival time may vary among different countries and the time needed to deliver the package to your place will be different. Please be patient. We ensure you that we will update the shipping progress once the shipping starts and the tracking number will be available in your survey later as well.\nD) How else can I stay in the loop?\nDefinitely consider taking a look at our Facebook group!\nWe hope the above information will help you out. Please stay tuned for more updates! Thanks again for all your love and support.\nKind regards,\nSainSmart Team",

            "text": "Hi Sainsmart Well done on closing out the campaign with great success. I would like to make a few requests for consideration. 1. Could you use a metal body for the base and rear for better strength and build quality/feel. To my knowledge it's plastic which would come across very cheap and not as rigid. 2. Could you make the item come default with the 20k motor and dust shoe. This would be welcomed by all I'm sure. 3. Can the screen possibly have a usbc port to plug in a usb touchscreen? This would make navigating the menu a bit nicer. 3. Would u consider a small e stop on the front for emergency. 4. Will you fix the concerns that the reviewer had about the perspex cover. He needed to 3d print something to strengthen the top. Thanks Hope to see this item come to fruition. Tristan",

        "content": "Hi friends,\nWe wanted to share two important updates with you:\n1. Dust Shoe Installation Guide \nWe've noticed that many of you are curious about how to properly install and use the dust shoe. To help ensure you get the best experience with your Cubiko, we‚Äôve put together a step-by-step guide for installation.\nDue to the height limitation, installing the dust shoe requires removing the enclosure cover. Here are the detailed steps for proper installation:\nStep 1: Remove the Enclosure Cover\nTake off the enclosure cover from Cubiko to prepare for the installation.\nStep 2: Install the Top Cover\nInstall the Top Cover of the dust shoe on the spindle with 2 pieces of M4 x 8 screws.\nStep 3: Install the Lower Chamber\nAlign the magnet at the top of the Lower Chamber with the magnet on the Top Cover. The Lower Chamber is then connected to the Top Cover of the dust shoe. \nStep 4: Install the Vacuum Cleaner Tube\nInsert the Vacuum Cleaner Tube with 32mm outer diameter into the tube  connection of the dust shoe Top Cover. \nWe hope this guide helps you set up your dust shoe smoothly!\n2. Shipping Update \nWe regret to inform you that, after extensive discussions with our internal logistics team, we found that shipping costs to non-EU European countries and Middle Eastern regions are quite high. As a result, we will not be offering shipping to these areas during the Kickstarter campaign.\nHowever, if you are still interested in purchasing Cubiko after the campaign ends,  please visit our site https://www.sainsmart.com and reach out to us there for more details. \nIf you wish to purchase Cubiko now and need to inquire about shipping costs to your country, please contact our customer support at hello@sainsmart.com.\nWe apologize for any inconvenience this may cause and appreciate your understanding.\nThank you for your continued support!\nBest regards,\nSainSmart Team",

Dust Shoe Is Available Now\nWe‚Äôve heard your requests! Many of you have asked for a dust shoe to make cleaning easier, and we heard you! The dust shoe add-on is now available. Pair it with your Cubiko for an even better experience.\n2. About Pledging The Early Bird Tier\nWe‚Äôre truly grateful for your overwhelming support for Cubiko! Here‚Äôs a quick clarification for pledging the Early Bird Tier:\nQ: I didn‚Äôt pre-order. Can I still purchase an Early Bird tier? \nWhile pre-ordering offered priority access to these tiers, it didn‚Äôt guarantee a specific tier due to the nature of the Kickstarter platform.\nIf you didn‚Äôt pre-order, you‚Äôre still welcome to check out the available tiers and secure your spot! However, you won't receive the pre-order gift: Chromatic Coating End Mills (3PCS).\nThank you for your amazing support, and we appreciate your patience as we work to bring Cubiko to life! üöÄ\nShare Cubiko with your friends to earn 7% Cash Back!\nBest Regards,\nSainSmart Team",
