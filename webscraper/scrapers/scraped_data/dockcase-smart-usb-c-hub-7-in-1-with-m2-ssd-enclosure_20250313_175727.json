This will guide you through the process of changing or retrying your payment method. Kickstarter'll also send you an email every 48 hours with a direct link to correct the issue.\nReference:\n My pledge was declined, can I fix this through the app? \nA project I'm backing just succeeded but my pledge was declined. What do I need to do next?\nWhat forms of payment can I use to make a pledge?\nCommon Pledge Problems\nWhat Happens if Collection Issues Aren't Resolved?\nIf backers don't resolve the payment issues within 7 days from campaign's deadline, their pledges are unfortunately dropped.\nWe will send you the survey and post an update after the 7-day pledge collection process. If you have any questions or concerns, please do not hesitate to reach out to us(service@dockcase.com). \nBest regards,  \nDockcase",
