However, I just scrolled down through your campaign section using my phone, and unfortunately, still nothing is being read aloud. I know this because I had my girlfriend read everything for me yesterday. Please, I really hope you will keep trying to improve accessibility. Thank you.",

        "content": "Hi everyone,\nFirst off, we want to say a huge thank you for your patience and support. Some of you have reached out about the lack of updates, and we completely understand. This being our first campaign, we weren’t familiar with how often we should be sending these out, but we’re here now and will make sure to keep you informed!\nThe Moment We Hit \"Launch\"  🚀\nWe’ll never forget the moment we hit that green \"Launch\" button. Months of late nights, testing, refining, and dreaming about this product had built up to that single click. It was equal parts exhilarating and terrifying. Within minutes, we saw the first backers roll in, and that’s when it really sank in: people believe in this vision just as much as we do.\nWe knew it was time to bring this idea to Kickstarter when we realized how much impact this product could have - not just for us, but for so many creators, gamers, and makers. The world of 3D interaction is evolving, and we wanted to be at the forefront, building something that truly enhances the way people create and explore. Kickstarter wasn’t just a way to fund the project, it was a way to build a community of people who share that vision.\nSome Incredible Milestones We’ve Hit  🎯\nSince launching just over two weeks ago, we’ve been completely blown away by the response. Here’s what we’ve achieved together so far:\n✅  50% funded in the first 2 hours\n✅  100% funded in the first 2 days\n✅  $100k+ raised in the first week\n✅  Selected as a Kickstarter 'Project We Love'\n✅  Now at 200%+ funded and still growing!\nNone of this would have been possible without YOU. Your enthusiasm, trust, and support mean everything to us. Thank you for believing in this project.\nWhere We’re At Today  🔧\nCampaign Updates: We’re working on adding more accessories/add-ons and sharing even more reactions from people trying out the MinVerse.\nSoftware Development: We’re deep in the development of the applications and software integrations - stay tuned for updates!\nCommunity Input: We’re actively posting on social media and online forums, exploring different interaction styles and features. If you haven’t joined the conversation yet, we’d love your input!\nWhat’s Next?  👀\nWe’ll be sending out regular updates moving forward to keep you in the loop. In the meantime, keep an eye on our social channels, and feel free to reach out with any questions or feedback!\nThank you for being part of this journey!\nThe Haply Team",
