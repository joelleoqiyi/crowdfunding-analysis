His wisdom and magical abilities possibly rival Gu‚ÄôGu‚Äôs, but his mind is so full of wonder that it has begun to blur. When he begins to murmur a spell, any intelligent creature should start to run; not even Mumbles knows what‚Äôs about to happen! Melody, an ancient moon dragon, has decided to watch over him and calm his mind with her song. His cap doubles as a hearing horn, which he needs to hear the melody. They‚Äôll help Stibbles and the team catch up to Gu‚ÄôGu, but Mumbles might not know why he‚Äôs even here.\nMelody\nMumbles\nThe Ghostfire Gaming Team",

As we mentioned in our last update, we sent out over 50 copies of the game and many people that covered it were kind enough to send us feedback or share their critical thoughts via a review. This is in addition to the many playtests we conducted. Here's what we've been working on these last few months:\n\nGame Difficulty\nThe number one piece of feedback we received from players was that the game is quite challenging. This was sometimes positive or negative depending on the player. We decided to leave the \"normal difficulty\" unchanged but have since been focused on providing streamlined rulesets for Easy and Hard modes so that players can customize the experience to their preferred difficulty. \n\nGame Balance \nA trend we noticed amongst playthroughs and from playtester feedback was that the game was harder at lower player counts and easier and higher player counts. We have made several small tweaks to the game to balance the difficulty of the game so that the game provides a similar challenge regardless of player count.\n\nFine Tuning Companion & Gnome Effects\nEnsuring that the effects players can activate are fun! Whilst we want a balanced game, we also want one that is focused on fun so that players can pull off crazy combos and create memorable moments! We reviewed all abilities and made sure they were balanced but still kept their fun factor!\n\nGame development is set to conclude at the end of March, in just one weeks time. With our commitment of having Companion Quest in your hands by this December, we're keeping up the pace to ensure we meet this commitment. More on the production timeline in the next update!\n\nPortal Problem Puzzle #4: One Big Problem - Easy\nIn One Big Problem, you have a lot of dice showing #1 - go figure! This presents a problem, Unstable Portal says that is cannot have dice of the same number placed on it. Ensure you use your companions wisely to manipulate the dice and overcome this problem!\nOne Big Problem - Easy\nIf you would like to try to solve this puzzle, you can find it setup in Tabletop Simulator to try right now! Please let us know how you went in the comments section. \n\nIf you want to see an example of how to complete this puzzle or you're having trouble solving it, watch the video below to see one of the possible solutions to this puzzle.\n\n\nThe Ghostfire Gaming Team",

In the lead up to the Kickstarter launch, we sent out roughly 50 pre-production copies of Companion Quest  to content creators. Here's what they thought...\n\nAll For One Games\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/DFadtvrsegA/?img_index=1 \n\"Highlights so far:\nüìñ 2 minute teach\nüëØ 1-4 players\nüß© Adjustable difficulty for all skill levels\nüé≤ Beautiful dice with fun tableau building and combos!\nü•∞ Adorable companions with powerful abilities\"\n\nPositively Board\nhttps://www.instagram.com/positively.board/p/DGWFWVMoRy4/?img_index=1 \n‚ÄúComponent-wise, all is excellent. Fantastic art style, lovely big Quest and Problem cards (the latter are amazing to look at). The dice are vibrant, and choosing the ones to play is a bit like visiting a sweet shop.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúThis one‚Äôs a keeper. I‚Äôve enjoyed the surprisingly tough challenge because the mechanics are spot on. If you love dice management games, you simply can‚Äôt miss this. I suspect this will make big waves in 2025‚Ä¶‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúVerdict: Excellent‚Äù\n\nWhat Board Game - Jim Gamer\nhttps://www.whatboardgame.com/post/companion-quest-board-game-preview\n‚ÄúThis is an addictive game.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúThe art is gorgeous, the production quality is right up there, and the rules are simple. The process you go through as you place the dice, complete the card challenges, and slowly make your way to victory is incredibly addictive.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúThe engine building part of the game is a hidden gem within the mechanics you may not first spot in the rules, but as the game goes on and you get better, it quickly becomes the most satisfying part.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúAs you start to get the hang of the strategy for this game and winning becomes a little more common, you can very easily ramp up the difficulty. This desire to win is what is making me come back to the game time and time again. The losses are always close, and you feel fully in control of your own destiny. So the losses are down to your own bad choices, and you want to get better so you make better ones next time!‚Äù\n\nLeige of Games \n4 Unexpectedly Awesome Board Games You Shouldn‚Äôt Ignore! \n\"It's freaking clever and it freaking works, it's really good.\"\n\n\"It's still going to be challenging enough that you can play it with your gamer group.\"\n\n\"This one easily exceeded expectations.\"\n\nWhere There‚Äôs a Wilz, There‚Äôs a Play\n[KICKSTARTER PREVIEW]-Companion Quest-Initial Impressions \n‚ÄúEven for a prototype, this is really well done. This right now is as good as some final copies of games that we own.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúWhen you look at each one of the individual components,  the Problems, Companion deck, Gnomes, and Quests, each one of those alone has a wide bit of variability. So you put all of those together and the replay-ability is great in this.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúI like the communication you have to have‚Ä¶ You do have to work together to get through everything that you need to do.‚Äù\n\nMerry Married Meeples\nCompanion Quest Preview - Work Together To Bring Peace To Our Gnome\n‚ÄúThere's quite a bit of depth to the decisions you have to make, and how you have to balance and manage things.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a lot of wonderful touches I‚Äôve already seen in this prototype version that makes me excited for what they‚Äôre going to do in the final version.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúIf you are looking for a game that has fun artwork, that has really fun tense decisions in a coop, that everyone can really work together and optimize what they‚Äôre doing then this is going to be it for you.‚Äù\n  Rabbles considers herself the proud leader of the McScooples family, although most of her siblings are very bad at listening to orders. She was once a chivalrous knight who served an influential noble family, but Rabbles grew tired of fighting for other people, and eventually retired from her job to live quietly in the woods. While gathering berries one day, she came across an injured Pygmy Owlbear and nursed him back to health. Now along with Runt, she will have to step back onto the path of danger to help save her family and the world, like she‚Äôs done a hundred times before.\nRunt\nRabbles\nThe Ghostfire Gaming Team",

This die is capable of being used as any other color, making it a powerful resource. However, in order to find the wild die you will need to find a Wild Card or tame a Wild Companion!\n\nThe Legendary Expansion - In this expansion, you may find and tame Legendary Companions. These companions are particularly useful not only because of their unique and powerful abilities but they also ready up when you place a certain number instead of color. Which allows you to potentially ready up two Companions with one die placement. \n\nFor example, I place a yellow #5 die, I have a Legendary Companion that readies up when a #5 die is placed and a regular Companion that readies up when a yellow die is placed. Therefore, you can ready up two Companions with one die placement. \nRegular Companions that have the ability to turn dice to a certain number compliment Legendary Companions very well!\n\nPortal Problem Puzzle #3: Pesky Problems - Medium\nIn Pesky Problems, you can deduce which dice must be placed on which danger card due to the color restrictions they have. The difficulty of this puzzle is getting the dice numbers high enough to meet or exceed the dangers health totals and defeat them. You must place your dice in the right order to take out the dangers.  \nPesky Problems - Medium\nIf you would like to try to solve this puzzle, you can find it setup in Tabletop Simulator to try right now!
