        "content": "Hello, backers!\nThis is the GOODLIFE Team.\nDue to your passionate support, 130 backers joined us. We can't hide my excitement\nand anticipation as we think about all of you becoming the first users of our product.\nWe are still a small startup, and we're not very familiar with the Kickstarter\ncommunity, but we want to communicate actively with you all because we believe\nour growth is only possible through your encouragement and interest.\nRecently, one of our backers gave us feedback on the product design. In fact, our\nfocus has been on the core functions and value of the product‚Äîenhancing user\nsafety through a smart internal mechanism‚Äîso we haven't paid as much attention to\nthe exterior design. However, hearing that the product will be placed in the users‚Äô\nspaces and will be seen daily, we realized that the design might be too plain and\nmonotonous. This feedback led us to spend some time reflecting deeply on the issue.\nOur product has specialized features, but since its internal components are not\ncurrently visible, how about creating a transparent case by adjusting the CMF (Color,\nMaterial, Finish) to upgrade feasible options and allow users to see how the product\nworks inside?\nWe believe that we can grow through communication and collaboration with our\nbackers. That's why we want to share this idea with you and hear your thoughts!\nPlease feel free to leave your opinions!\nThank you.\n[The GOODLIFE Team]",

            "text": "Dear Eran Gabber First of all, we sincerely appreciate your interest in our products and the valuable feedback you have shared with us. As many customers have expressed their desire for a transparent product, we are actively reviewing this possibility. However, at this stage, it is difficult for us to confirm the release schedule or method. The reasons are as follows: 1) To apply a transparent material, we must use a UL-certified material that meets the standards of the U.S. electrical product safety certification body (ETL) and obtain approval. 2) Our current products use ABS flame-retardant grade 1 material.   This material is excellent for precisely molding even the fine functional parts inside the product. 3)  Most transparent products on the market use polycarbonate (PC) material.    However, polycarbonate (PC) has a different composition from the ABS material we currently use, and due to its lower processability, it is difficult to use with our existing molds. 4) Therefore, we are actively reviewing transparent ABS flame-retardant grade 1 materials that not only meet ETL certification standards but also offer excellent processability and compatibility with our existing molds. Due to these factors, it is challenging to implement the change immediately.There are still many other aspects to consider, but we are committed to finding the best possible solution. While we regret that we are unable to provide a transparent material product right away, we kindly ask for your understanding. Once again, thank you for your valuable feedback and interest.Wishing you a wonderful day ahead. [GOODLIFE TEAM]",
