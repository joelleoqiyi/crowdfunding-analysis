After just 10 days, our campaign is 377% funded with 154 amazing backers—thank you all for believing in HIIVE Link!\nWe’ve also been listening to your feedback. Many of you asked for an option to connect without Wi-Fi. This was already part of our product and hardware design, but we hadn’t made it available as an add-on—until now! We’ve just introduced the Cellular Module, which plugs directly into the HIIVE Link Gateway and allows you to insert a SIM card for remote data access, no Wi-Fi needed.\nThank you again for your incredible support—let’s keep this momentum going!\n\nYour HIIVE Team!",
