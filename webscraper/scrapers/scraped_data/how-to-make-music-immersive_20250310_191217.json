        "content": "Dear backers, friends, family, patrons, new listeners + long-time listeners.. \nEach time one of you has backed my project here, it feels like a miracle in my day-to-day. \nI am writing a lot of new material, researching and learning new things about the ways I want to record and perform my songs live.  I really hope this project is successful and I can't wait to put new music together.  The album will be called 'Fountain'.  \nThanks for your collective support, I appreciate it so very much.\nEmika",
