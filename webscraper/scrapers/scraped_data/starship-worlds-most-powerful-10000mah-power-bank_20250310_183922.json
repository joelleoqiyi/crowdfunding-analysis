Hmmm a lot of reasons: The best thing about the Aohi The best thing about the AoHi Starship Pro 10,000mAh power bank is its insane 210W total output in such a compact form. It's rare to find a power bank this small that can fast-charge a laptop, phone, and other devices simultaneously. The dual USB-C ports with 140W and 70W power delivery make it super versatile, whether you're charging a MacBook, Steam Deck, or a smartphone. I also really like the 90W fast input, which means you can recharge it to 60% in just 15 minutes. That‚Äôs a game-changer compared to typical power banks that take hours to refill. Plus, the smart digital display showing real-time wattage is a nice touch for tech enthusiasts who like to monitor their power usage. I am really excited with this new projects again.",
