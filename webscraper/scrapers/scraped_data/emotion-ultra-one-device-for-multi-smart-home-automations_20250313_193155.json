        "content": "Dear Supporters,\nThank you very much for your enthusiastic support of our crowdfunding project! It is your encouragement and trust that enable us to continuously improve our product and strive to deliver a better user experience.\nIf you have any new ideas or requirements, please feel free to leave a comment. We are eager to listen and do our best to meet your expectations.\nTo further enhance the performance and compatibility of our product, we have carried out two rounds of hardware iteration upgrades during the crowdfunding period:\nWe redesigned and tested the 60GHz mmWave radar module antenna to improve overall performance.\nTo support Matter, HomeKit, and SmartThings, we upgraded the original Realtek 8720CF WiFi chip to Realtek 8720CM, and increased the available chip memory to 4MB.\nWhile these upgrades have significantly enhanced the functionality of our product, they have also led to some delays in our development progress. The good news is that we have now completed the prototyping phase, and our supply chain team is working closely with our manufacturing partners in China to expedite the production testing process. Due to the impact of these hardware upgrades, the original delivery schedule set for the end of March will be delayed by approximately three weeks. We sincerely apologize for any inconvenience this may cause and appreciate your understanding.\nOnce again, thank you for your support and patience. We will continue our efforts to bring you an even better product and experience. Please stay tuned for further updates‚Äîwe will share the latest progress with you as soon as possible!\nSincerely,\nThe Project Team",

A more \"flexible\" DC power input, e.g. allow DC in to be anything from 5V to 12V. I am very eager to get my hands on an eMotion Ultra ...",

        "content": "Dear Pledgers and Smart Home Enthusiasts,\nOver the past few months, our team has made comprehensive improvements, refining everything from the antenna‚Äôs physical design to the signal processing architecture. Today, we are excited to introduce the eMotion Ultra will be powered by the 2nd-Gen 60GHz mmWave radar module, expertly designed by the LinknLink team!\nThe upgrade from our 1st-Gen 60GHz mmWave Radar technology focuses on optimizing antenna design and enhancing transmission efficiency.\nTechnical Improvements:\nAntenna Optimization: The new 2T2R antenna design reduces signal scattering, suppresses multipath interference, and improves weak signal detection at long distances. It maintains a ¬±60¬∞ beam angle, with better sensitivity at the edges.\nIncreased Power Efficiency: The effective radiated power (ERP) is increased by 20%, while maintaining 12dBm transmission power. A stable power supply ensures consistent performance even in fluctuating conditions.\nCo-optimized Algorithms and Hardware: Upgraded signal processing algorithms accurately identify static and micro-motion targets, while dynamic interference shielding filters out fixed interferences. The low-power mode reduces consumption to 2.5mA during idle times.\nTest Results: Internal tests show a 7-meter detection range with 98% accuracy for static targets, outperforming the first-gen model in complex environments.\nCommitment: eMotion Ultra is a hardware upgrade and a step towards smarter, seamless interaction. We‚Äôll continue to improve the product with future OTA updates. Thank you for your support - eMotion Ultra is nearing mass production, promising an enhanced smart experience.\nBest Regards\nLinknLink Team",
