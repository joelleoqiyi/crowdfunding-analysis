        "content": "Dear Backers,\nThanks to your incredible support, weâ€™ve officially hit 500% of our funding goal! ðŸŽ‰ Weâ€™re blown away by the enthusiasm and belief youâ€™ve shown in Super Cable 2.0â€”thank you for being part of this amazing journey.\nWe also want to thank the backers who pointed out an issue with the add-ons: the option to upgrade from 0.5m to 1mwas mistakenly limited to a quantity of 1. That has now been corrected, and you can select multiple upgrades as needed.\nhttps://www.kickstarter.com/projects/thehorizon/beyond-limits-introducing-the-next-generation-supercable20/rewards\nYour feedback helps us improve, and we truly appreciate your sharp eyes and support. Letâ€™s keep pushingâ€”more exciting milestones are ahead!\nWith gratitude,\nThe team",
