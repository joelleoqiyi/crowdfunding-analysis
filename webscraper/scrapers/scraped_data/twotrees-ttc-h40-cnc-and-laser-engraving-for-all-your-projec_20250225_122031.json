Really appreciate efforts to keep transport costs down, I reckon I might own a big boat by now with shipping costs to Oz. Any chance Amazon can't be involved or are all your nuts already in the fire. Anyway jokes aside, keen to understand best cnc tooling and output control and compatibility for laser.",
