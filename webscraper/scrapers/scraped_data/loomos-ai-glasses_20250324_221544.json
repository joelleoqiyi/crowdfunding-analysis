It DOES show how horrible the logo on the side looks. It's so cheap and cheesy looking. Also, the magnetic sunglasses style is horrible. That shape CANT be the final design, right? I was hoping this review would make me want to keep my pledge, but this is not looking good. They continue to focus on standby battery life only (which barely matters) and never focus on actual use time. I am SURE it will be 1-2 hours at best. Sigh. The HUGE logo in chrome and the sunglasses are a huge turn off to MOST backers. And they've basically ignored backers about it or simply said \"you will very good, don't worry\". Change our minds Loomos! I don't want to cancel, but I'm losing faith.",

Loomos A1 has raised $1,178,592 from 4,342 backers in just 4 days - an achievement beyond our wildest dreams. We are deeply grateful for every backer who believed in our project!\nAlong with sharing these impressive numbers, we know you've been eagerly awaiting sample photos taken with the loomos. While the current image quality reaches about 65% of our target, we're confident in the potential of our 16MP camera with SONY CMOS sensor. We are committed to fine-tuning and perfecting the camera performance before shipping.\nPlease note that Kickstarter's platform compresses images, which may result in slight blurring of the sample photos we're sharing.\n  Regarding our project timeline, we're pleased to announce that we may be able to ship earlier than initially planned. We've resolved all hardware-related challenges and are ready to begin mass production. However, we still need some time to refine the software aspects, including:\nCamera optimization\nBluetooth connectivity improvements\nAdditional feature implementation\n  Once again, we cannot thank you enough for your support. We wouldn't be where we are today without our amazing backers!",
