Thank you all so much for supporting our campaign and helping us make this a reality! \nSo far we’ve reached almost $38,000 from 242 backers! This has been awesome and the good news is we still have 24 days left in our campaign! \n\nWith your help, we can spread the word about the UltraLite and get it into as many people's hands as possible. \nShare link: https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/ultralite/the-ultralite-a-light-for-all-devices\nAppreciate your support and spreading the word! Remember, the UltraLite ships in August, and when the campaign ends in March, you'll get a survey for shipping details. \n\n- Justin Mclure\nUltraLite Founder\n\nP.S: If you have any questions, comments, or suggestions about our campaign, please feel free to reach out to us directly at: justin@theultralite.com.
