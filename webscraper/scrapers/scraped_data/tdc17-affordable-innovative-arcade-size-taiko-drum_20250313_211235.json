Everything is progressing according to schedule, and we appreciate your patience and support. Here‚Äôs where things stand:\n1Ô∏è‚É£ Production on Track ‚Äì This week, we will complete the final assembly of the TDC17 and begin quality control checks. The packaging boxes are currently in production and are expected to be completed and delivered next week.\n2Ô∏è‚É£ New Drumsticks in Development ‚Äì The F5 drumsticks, designed specifically for the TDC17, are in production. We‚Äôve also designed two additional models, F3 and F8, all 37cm in length. Since each requires its own mold, adjustments have taken longer than expected. Additionally, the current production yield needs improvement. While this has caused some delays in this part of production, it does not impact the overall timeline.\n3Ô∏è‚É£ Shipping Schedule ‚Äì We are still on track for the first batch of TDC17 shipments to begin on March 15 as planned.\nThank you again for your patience and support! We‚Äôll continue to keep you updated as we move closer to shipping. If you have any questions, feel free to reach out.\nBest,\nrythmagica team",
