        "content": "You‚Äôre about to read a short story that touches on mistakes, love, the butterfly effect, and determination‚Äîa combination that blends ingenuity and precision with the most human part of us, in a field where there‚Äôs often little room for emotions.\nSome of you may already know about my project, nsOne. I‚Äôve previously stated that it was born out of an accident, a failure, but I never really explained what happened in detail.\nThis happened about a year ago. I wanted to start programming software for my PlayStation 1, but I needed a serial cable, which I didn‚Äôt have. So, I decided to design one as a PCB. While taking measurements and checking the pins with a multimeter, I made a complete beginner‚Äôs mistake‚Äîjust a tiny short circuit.\nNow, after all the research and studying I‚Äôve done on the console, it would take me no more than five minutes to figure out which fuse burned out and replace it. But a year ago, that wasn‚Äôt the case. Instead, I took it as an opportunity to learn, and little by little, I began studying every single trace on the console, every single connection. By now, I even know the functions of all 800+ pins by heart. Sometimes, I challenge my friend to point at a random pin, and I have to name it and say what it does. Even he was shocked.\nBut a year ago, I wasn‚Äôt like this. I don‚Äôt have any special skills‚ÄîI just had dedication.\nI kept this project to myself until December 2024, when I decided to share it with the world, thanks in part to Hackaday Magazine, which published the very first article about it.\nLet‚Äôs take a quick step back to March 2024, when I was designing that PCB connector‚Äîthe exact red one you see in the image. At the time, I was in a relationship with a beautiful girl, kind-hearted and full of love. My first love.\nThat serial connector wasn‚Äôt my first PCB design; I had already worked on a few projects before. And in every one of them, I always loved blending ‚Äúacademic precision‚Äù with my creative and human side. Whenever I finished designing a PCB, I would take the time to add little Easter eggs, things that represented who I was, leaving space for a small artistic touch. It was my canvas.\nAnd for this connector, I dedicated it to the thing I loved the most‚Äîher.\nThe white lip prints you see on it? They‚Äôre hers. I scanned them from a love letter she once wrote me. The phrase ‚ÄúTI AMO‚Äù (‚ÄúI love you‚Äù) is taken directly from that same letter, in her own handwriting, with all the love she put into it. The only thing I added was ‚Äú(io di pi√π)‚Äù‚Äî‚ÄúI love you more‚Äù‚Äîa phrase she used to say with pure innocence, and one I would always repeat back to her.\nThis connector was a tribute to her.\nAnd it was while making this very connector that I short-circuited my console‚Äîat a time when I didn‚Äôt have the skills to diagnose and fix the problem.\nnsOne was born entirely by accident.\nThis project was born from a mistake while designing a serial cable filled with details of love. And now, the fruits of that mistake are helping me forget that love.\nFast forward to January 2025‚Äîshe‚Äôs gone from my life. Everything is falling apart, and I‚Äôm going through the worst time of my life, completely alone. I decide to go all in, and on January 21, 2025, I launch the Kickstarter campaign.\nI would have never guessed that a microscopic mistake from a year ago‚Äîa simple 3.3V short circuit‚Äîwould create such a massive butterfly effect. I never imagined that such a beginner‚Äôs error would become my lifeline in one of the hardest moments of my life, a year later.\nRunning this campaign for the past two months and working on this project has been my salvation‚Äîa hope that, at the very least, helped me distract myself from all the pain and the breakup. If I hadn‚Äôt taken the leap to bring this project to life, I honestly don‚Äôt know how much lower I would have fallen. This project became a life raft for my heart, a positive distraction while it was still trying to heal.\nAnd it‚Äôs still trying to heal.\nSometimes, I wonder‚Äîif she had stayed, would I have even tried to create something this big? Or would I have stayed in my comfort zone, never pushing forward? Maybe, at first, I did all of this to prove to her what I was capable of‚Äîas wrong as that motivation may have been.\nBut now, I continue for me. Solely for me.\nI wonder if she would be proud of what I‚Äôve accomplished.\nBut I guess that will remain one of the many mysteries of the universe.\n\nOra sono costretto a ricordarti per pi√π tempo di quanto ti abbia conosciuta. Lo so, lo so. Il tuo pupo ha sempre avuto questa vena sentimentale, anche se sembrava scomparsa. Magari in un altra vita Brunilda.\nIl tuo pupo, Lorentio Brodesco - 21 marzo 2025",

Such a wonderful personal journey you've been on. Thanks for sharing. Life's challenges like this are a way for us, emergent islands of the universe becoming self-aware enough to collect experiences, unique in all the cosmos, just for us. Even when the journey is hard, how we accept that life experience is where the meaning is; where we, the universe get to find our own reasons to continue. So many things needed to align just right to see things from the right perspective. Instead of stopping at the passive acceptance, by which most others would be satisfied, you made the choice to make something positive for the world. Nicely done, Sir!",

Gamers in the future will know of the effort you put into making sure we have the circuit boards right and can make new ones for repairs, or even for FPGA emulation. My next challenge to you after this is to do high resolution delidded scans of all the chips in all laters to completely clone them, but on a far newer and more efficient node. This way the platform can be entirely preserved and new chips can be made as well.",

Unlike the first schematic, I am not using resistor arrays for convenience (at least for now) but rather individual SMD resistors with a 0201 footprint.\nFor this board, I have not yet included chips like the Mechacon or other \"non-essential\" components, as this is just a debug unit to ensure proper functionality. It does not include audio either, but those are truly irrelevant modifications for boot testing.\nAdditionally, I am working on a design with fewer connection crossovers and optimizing routing lengths to make them as equal as possible, avoiding potential issues.\nI will release further updates in the coming days with a more complete board.\nI am also considering adding an onboard RP2040 to test the Pico-based ODE that was recommended to me for loading games directly from a microSD.\nAdditionally, I am carefully selecting all components to ensure that, besides manufacturing, all boards are also compatible with the pre-assembly of all components.",
