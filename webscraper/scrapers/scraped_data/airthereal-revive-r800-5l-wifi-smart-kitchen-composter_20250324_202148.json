With WiFi smart features and carbon footprint tracking, we canâ€™t wait to see how the R800 helps reduce waste and transform your kitchen into a greener space.\nVAT/Taxes Survey\nWe will be sending out a survey via PledgeBox to collect your shipping details and VAT/Tax information. This survey will arrive 14 days after the campaign ends, following Kickstarterâ€™s standard payment process. Weâ€™ll also post a reminder when itâ€™s time to complete the survey.\nUpgraded LED Screen Frame\nWeâ€™ve upgraded the LED screen frame from black to a sleek silver-plated finish, perfectly complementing the modern gray exterior. This refined design enhances the overall look of the Revive R800, making it a stylish addition to any space.\nProduction Testing Updates\nWeâ€™re excited to share the latest Revive R800 production update! Our production sample is currently undergoing rigorous testing, and hereâ€™s what weâ€™ve accomplished so far:\nDrop Test Passed\nThe Revive R800 successfully endured full-unit drop testing, ensuring it can withstand shipping and handling without damage.\nThe image shows the packaging before the drop test:\nThese images show the machine after the drop test, demonstrating its durability:\nControl Panel Testing: In Progress\nWe are currently testing both the machine screen and the app interface to ensure seamless performance.\nAfter completing an Eco Mode, the Eco Mode data displayed on the machine screen matches the data shown in the app:\nWe appreciate your patience and support as we continue refining the Revive R800. Stay tuned for more updates!\nBest,\nAirthereal Team",
