        "content": "Hey folks,\nWIRECARE Plus is designed to test the safety condition of home outlets, primarily measuring the level of aging in outlets and wires by evaluating the loop impedance to assess wire health. Operation is simple—just insert it into an outlet and within approximately 10 seconds, a three-color display (green, orange, red) shows the test results and GFCI (Ground Fault Circuit Interrupter) status, helping users quickly determine if there are potential problems in the electrical system.\nSimply plug WIRECARE Plus into an outlet and it automatically begins testing, quickly presenting various factors that affect outlet safety.\nCompared to the first generation, WIRECARE Plus features an extension cord plug design, making it suitable for use in various locations such as high places, outlets behind large furniture/equipment, etc. It can also be fitted with different plug specifications to test outlets of varying standards.\nThrough this easier-to-operate design, we hope to make outlet testing less troublesome than imagined. No need to dismantle outlets—just plug it in to test and ensure outlet safety, eliminating electrical risks.\nThank you for believing in WIRECARE Plus!

        "content": "Hey Folks,\nFirst of all, thanks for all of your support. In case you want to know more about WIRECARE Plus, we would like to share out initial thought why we want to create WIRECARE Plus\nMost people don't pay attention to whether the outlets they're using are safe. If an outlet looks normal on the outside, they assume there are no risks in using it. However, the truth is that even if an outlet appears clean and normal, the wiring behind it may already be aging or damaged.\nWhen people hear about testing outlets, they might first think of using outlet testers, multimeters, or hiring an electrician. But without knowledge of how to use these tools, it can be difficult to determine whether an outlet needs to be replaced.\nWIRECARE Plus was created to provide intuitive testing results. Through light indicators and simple operation, anyone can easily determine if an outlet is safe. We hope to eliminate the stereotype that testing outlets is troublesome, encourage regular outlet testing, and thereby prevent electrical fires or even more serious disasters. Enjoy a safe and comfortable living environment.\nThank you for believing in WIRECARE Plus!

Thank you to everyone that pledged, everyone that shared our project, everyone that provided feedback and everyone that helped spread the word about WIRECARE Plus!\n\nMost people wouldn’t actively check the wiring condition of their outlets, yet faulty outlet wiring is one of the top three causes of household fires.\nTo help more people avoid the risk of outlet-related fires, we designed WIRECARE Plus—a user-friendly and efficient tool that quickly assesses outlet wiring conditions. Even those without electrical knowledge can use it with ease. With your support, we can make this dream come true and we will do our best to conquer this adventure together!\nThank you for believing in WIRECARE Plus!

        "content": "Hey Folks,\nAfter receiving numerous requests from our international customers, we have decided to make WIRECARE Plus available worldwide, except in regions using the UK standard plug (UG-D) and other specific countries.\nThe reason we cannot offer WIRECARE Plus in regions using the UK standard plug is that this plug type contains an internal fuse, which affects the resistance ratio during measurement. To avoid any potential concerns regarding usage, we will not be offering purchases to countries using these plug standards in this crowdfunding campaign. We appreciate your understanding.\nNote1: We will continue to provide a US-type extension cord with reward packages. Supporters who do not use a US-type plug can purchase a compatible extension cord from their local electrical retailer. If you have any questions, feel free to message us.\n\nNote2:  Import duties and taxes may vary by country and additional charges may apply at customs clearance. Please consult official customs documentation.\n\nHope we can make our goal as soon as possible and provide more benefit to you guys soon!\nStay Tune,\nWIRECARE Plus Team",
