However, we encountered an unexpected challenge‚ÄîUSPS has returned all our shipments due to restrictions on lithium batteries, causing delays and postage losses. We are actively exploring alternative shipping solutions and will make another attempt soon.\nPlease note that shipping regulations vary by country, and while we are doing our best to resolve these issues, in some strict cases, we may need to issue refunds. Alternatively, if there‚Äôs an opportunity for bulk shipments or distribution partnerships in your region, we‚Äôd love to explore that as a solution.\nThank you for your patience and support as we work through these logistics. We‚Äôll keep you updated!\nBest,\nThe InsGlo Team",

        "content": "Dear Backers,\nWe have now locked all backer addresses and are actively preparing for fulfillment. But we have encountered new challenges along the way. Recent changes in U.S. tariff policies under the Trump administration have caused turbulence in global logistics, leading to unexpected shipping delays and backlogs. We are working diligently to resolve these issues as quickly as possible.\nAdditionally, due to the complexity and restrictions around shipping battery related products, we regret to inform you that we are unable to ship the Powerstick as originally planned. To ensure a smoother and faster delivery process, we will be upgrading it with an additional InsGlo device in a different color. This alternative is of significantly higher value and provides you with an extra style option to complement your routine. We appreciate your understanding and hope you enjoy this upgrade.\nPlease note that customs clearance at different countries may require cooperation from the receiver, and we will reach out with specific instructions if needed.\nThank you for your patience and support. We‚Äôre doing everything we can to get InsGlo to you as soon as possible! Please feel free to reach out if you have any questions.\nBest regards,\nJoey",
