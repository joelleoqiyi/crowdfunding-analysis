This is to avoid a temperature shift, but to create better adhesion through the heated chamber. Perhaps you should check with a university or professors to find out which fillament requires which ‘heated chamber temperature’. And also indicate this info on the sticker of the fillament, so that we can set the printer properly before we start printing.",

I have a 90lb brick sitting on my desk with 9 other working printers. Once things start going wrong with that printer they just keep getting worse. Quite a number of us have similar issues and have more down time than print time! Hopefully, since Eryone seems to have designed this for Production and not prosumers, it will be different.",

If you're looking to use a 3D printer for manufacturing end-use products or parts, we recommend the Thinker X400. It's a production-grade printer known for its stability and ease of use, especially beneficial if you require multiple printers for manufacturing.",
