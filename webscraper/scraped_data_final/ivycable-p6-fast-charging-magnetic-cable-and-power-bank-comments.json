During pass-through fast charging (when devices like smartphones are charged through the IVYCABLE connected to a charger), it functions as a standard charging cable, directly transferring all the power from the charger to the device. Once the device is fully charged, the IVYCABLE P6 then draws 5V (Max. 2.4A) from the charger to recharge its built-in battery until it is fully charged.",

            "comment": "That’s a very good question! As you’ve noted regarding heat loss, the actual capacity delivered to the phone from the battery will have some level of loss, with the typical conversion rate around 70%. However, depending on the circuit design, the thickness of the PCB copper traces, and the cross-sectional area of the wires, the conversion efficiency can vary. Of course, there are other factors that influence efficiency, so the conversion rate may differ. The rated capacity of Ivycable P6 is 3000mAh, which is its minimum capacity. Based on our actual tests, Ivycable P6 can fully charge an iPhone 12 Mini once. Since the standard capacity of the iPhone 12 Mini is 2227mAh, the conversion efficiency of Ivycable P6 can reach 74%, which is more than sufficient for a day’s worth of outdoor backup power for the phone. Thank you very much for sharing such a professional question here, and once again, thank you for your support of Ivycable P6!",
