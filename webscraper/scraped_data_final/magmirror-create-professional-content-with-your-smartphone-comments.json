We understand that a reliable external mic solution is crucial for your videos, and we're actively working on a USB hub for non-Bluetooth mics so you can use your existing gear without extra expense. Some details are still being finalized, but rest assured our team is working diligently and we'll keep you updated as we progress.",

Backer #104 here~ Unfortunately after much deliberation, I‚Äôm amending my pledge for now to monitor progress as there‚Äôs no certainty/update yet concerning using external mic after plugging MagMirror to my phone. It‚Äôs a deal breaker for me. But I will be back on board if the other usb port could address this especially with a demo of any of the mics ( rode/ dji mics) working to help confirm it.",
