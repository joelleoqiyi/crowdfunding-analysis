Both are Turing-complete and designed for educational purposes, but instead of dragging blocks on a screen, our system lets kids stack coding bricks to create real, tangible programs. Plus, our interpreter is written in Python, and programs built with DrBartha Toys can also be translated to Scratch, bridging physical and digital programming environments.",
