It's AI-powered tracking works with any phone or app, making it a game-changer for livestreams, video calls, and third-party camera apps. Plus, it supports multiple device types‚Äîsmartphones, mirrorless cameras, compact cameras, and action cameras‚Äîso you won‚Äôt need separate gimbals for different gear.",
