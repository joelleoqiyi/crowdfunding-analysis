In fact, their website does not display all the projects, but in fact, the projects they recommend far exceed what is displayed on the homepage. Have a nice day!",

Mouse and keyboard can be connected to the monitor. Is this setup possible, preferably without a DP to HDMI adapter?",

Tsupy supports dual-host control, single 4K display output, and PD charging. However, for multi-screen setups, an additional solution is required. HDMI supports up to 4K@60Hz.",

As for 4K@120Hz, Tsupy itself supports 4K@120Hz output, but the actual performance will depend on the capabilities of the hub you're using. Make sure the hub is compatible with 4K@120Hz to ensure smooth performance.",
