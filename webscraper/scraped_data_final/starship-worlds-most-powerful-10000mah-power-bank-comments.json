Please if you would be so kind as to list any and all things that make them different? I do notice that you state that this one is 210W and the one on Indiegogo is 240W... Yet to me I do not see any (other) difference? I know that I am no specialist in Power Banks so this is one of the reasons I am asking for a little help in understanding the differences and possible pros & cons with each of the units? Your explanations will hopefully help me to make up my mind on witch one to Back, the one here on Kickstarter or the one on Indiegogo?",
