I hope this is something that can be improved because there is an excessive amount of blue in the colors. I’m not sure if this is a result of the camera used in the filming. A side-by-side comparison with an OLED TV would have been helpful as a benchmark. Of course, I understand it wouldn’t be as contrasty as an OLED, but that would give us a clearer idea of how it measures up.",

A good amount of people will be canceling as this is an expensive purchase for many people and many people have been scammed many times. Please upload a video showing a 360 view around the projector while it is running and get those reviews done as soon as possible. I know I will be canceling if I do not see any progress soon. The review should be up before the product launches or as soon as it launches. You will have more people interested if they know about it in advance.

I don’t trust the big tech reviewers as they lie for sponsorships. I would have liked to see “Chigz Tech Reviews” do a review of this product and I would recommend this company to look into that. He covers low and high end products, always non bias and he puts everything on a rating scale.
