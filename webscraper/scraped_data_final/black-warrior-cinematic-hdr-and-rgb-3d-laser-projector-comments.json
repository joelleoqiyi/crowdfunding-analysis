A side-by-side comparison with an OLED TV would have been helpful as a benchmark.

A good amount of people will be canceling as this is an expensive purchase for many people and many people have been scammed many times. Please upload a video showing a 360 view around the projector while it is running and get those reviews done as soon as possible. I know I will be canceling if I do not see any progress soon. The review should be up before the product launches or as soon as it launches. You will have more people interested if they know about it in advance.
