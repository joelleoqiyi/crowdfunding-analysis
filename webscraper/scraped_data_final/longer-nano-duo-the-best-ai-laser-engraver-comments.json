I'm looking for times under 1 minute—preferably around 30 seconds. If this model can’t do it, which one can? Which laser beam (Diode or IR) would be used to achieve this? What hard materials (other than paper) can I use for detailed 30-second or 1-minute photo engravings with your laser or similar lasers? I want a quick, one-pass, permanent surface mark with high contrast. I am not necessarily trying to achieve very deep engraving for this project. I'm open to using coated or anodized aluminum to enhance speed and vibrancy. I plan to do engravings on-site, so I prioritize portability and speed over achieving the absolute highest quality.

The Nano Duo galvo laser can engrave photos on 4x4-inch slate or tile, but achieving engraving times under 1 minute—especially around 30 seconds—may be challenging, depending on the complexity of the image and the settings used. For hard materials like slate or tile, an infrared laser is preferred, as it provides better contrast and speed than diode lasers.
