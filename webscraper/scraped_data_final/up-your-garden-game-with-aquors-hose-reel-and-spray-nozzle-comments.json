I suspect this is a misprint but can I receive confirmation that the $375 pledge (plus shipping) will actually grant 2 Charcoal Retractable Hose Reels prior to pledging.",

I selected the Charcoal 2pack because I plan on installing a 2nd hydrant. I would also have backed the spray nozzles but they aren't available as an add on. I wish you would have had a ( 2pack hose reel with 2 pack nozzles) as a choice because I would have chosen that to increase my pledge. I really hope this gets funded because I love your innovative products and am very excited about these new ones. These are exactly the additional products I was hoping you'd offer.",
