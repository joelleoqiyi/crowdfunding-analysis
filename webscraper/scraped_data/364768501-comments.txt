As someone that is entirely new to photography, are lenses and filters compatible with this Cinnotown lens? If so, where can they be obtained? The lens say they are 35mm in diameter, and i don't know if they produce lenses and filters at that size.

Hi,

This lens does not require a filter.

The description says it clips on to any android phone lens. Does that mean every single android lens have identical/similar specs to each other from all the models and companies? And if not can I just use the iPhone adjuster to attach it?

The lens clip is suitable for Android phones. This product is suitable for over 95% of mobile phones on the market.

How long to charge battery and what is the runtimes?

Hi Sonny,

The battery capacity is 60maH, the charging time is about 1.5 hours, the first gear fully lit discharge time is about 2 hours, and the second gear half lit for about 3.5 hours.

Please tell us the f-stop of the unit - Thank you

Hi Bambi,

The aperture of this macro lens is the aperture of a mobile phone.

With battery? Built-in and how to charge? Changeable?

Hi Weber,

It has a built-in battery, and we will have a Type-C charging cable.

How does the light work?

Hi Weber,

Thank you for your support and reminder.

We have asked the staff to add a dynamic image on the page, which you can view. We have a button to turn on the light.
