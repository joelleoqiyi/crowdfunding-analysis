Hey guys! I saw your project on Facebook, and when I checked it out here, I realized this product is a total game-changer. I ordered two right away‚Äîone for myself and one for my mom, and I‚Äôll be using it as a social companion. Quick question though‚Äîcan I add essential oils to the water to use it as an aroma diffuser?

Hey Jack!

Thank you for backing our product and sharing your feedback on FaceAI! We hope you and your mom will be absolutely delighted with it.

We've received similar suggestions from other backers about adding essential oils, and our team is actively exploring this idea. Stay tuned for updates!

If you have any other suggestions, please let us know!

Hello, Excuse me, is there any way it can be used in Spanish?

Hello Claudia!

Yes, Face AI supports Spanish.

Please let us know if you have any further questions.

OK, to be honest, the answers will not change my decision to back this project, I truly am excited to see what the potential is. But first question is related to the use for 'golden years'. I want to give my mum one of my reward units to act almost as a social companion. But my mum is a bit 'uncomfortable' with anything bad like 'AI' with a general intolerance to things that are 'tech'.So, for a case study, I may be interesting ü§î.

So I like the eyes üëÄ and I am hoping that they will help my mum gain the benefit of this device. But there is no way I will be able to persuade her to refill the water. I will do that when I visit. But even if the eyes have run out of water, will the AI function still work? And would it be ok to leave it powered up without water?

Hey Phil,

Thanks for your enthusiasm and support for FaceAI! It‚Äôs great to hear that you see its potential, especially as a companion for your mum.

In fact, when we first envisioned FaceAI, one of our key audiences was seniors and kids ‚Äî so you‚Äôre spot on. We completely understand that the older generation can be skeptical about AI and tech, but FaceAI is designed to be an intuitive and friendly presence rather than a complicated gadget.

Regarding the water tank, FaceAI can operate for up to 8 hours on a full tank (about 13.5 ounces). Once the water runs out, the device will automatically turn off until it‚Äôs refilled. However, the AI itself ‚Äî its voice interactions and responses ‚Äî will continue to work even without water. The only difference is that the visual holographic display won‚Äôt be active.

As for your story, we‚Äôd love to hear more! If you have a unique perspective to share, feel free to message us privately on Kickstarter or via email faceai.team@gmail.com ‚Äî we‚Äôre always open to insightful conversations.

Best,

The FaceAI Team

If I could ask a further, rambling question, I would be grateful....

I am looking forward to receiving a unit that I shall gift to my mum. I hope that will become a distinct AI personality for my mum. At the same time, I have a unit of my own waiting for dispatch ü§û But if I ordered multiple units for my own use (office, home or workshop) can I synchronise the personality across multiple devices?

That would be really, really cool üòé

Thanks, Phil! We love your enthusiasm!

Currently, FaceAI is designed for one user per device, allowing for personalization through the mobile app. However, we appreciate your idea, and a multi-device synchronization feature is something we may explore in the future. Stay tuned for updates!

If I use my own ChatGPT account, are their any additional fees that I will need to pay to use this product moving forward?

Hey Mark! Thanks for your interest in FaceAI!

After the one-year free subscription, if you switch to your own ChatGPT account, you can continue using FaceAI without any additional fees.

If you have any other questions, don‚Äôt hesitate to ask!

This project is really cool! I‚Äôve never used Kickstarter before, but this idea instantly caught my attention. It feels like something straight out of sci-fi, and it‚Äôs amazing to see technology like this becoming a reality. I‚Äôm excited to see how it works‚Äîwishing the team lots of success!

Hey Daniel,

Thank you so much for your feedback. We're glad to hear that our project caught your attention, and we hope you'll enjoy the device once it's in your hands.

Hello! The product looks amazing, and I love that it‚Äôs a hologram, not just a screen‚Äîwow! I‚Äôm curious to know more about the technology you use to create the holographic effect.

Hey Sophia! Thanks for your interest in FaceAI!

We use advanced fog screen technology, where an ultra-thin layer of mist acts as an invisible projection surface. Unlike traditional fog screens, which rely on front projection, we utilize rear projection technology. This ensures the light source remains hidden, creating a true holographic illusion with sharper visuals and minimal distortion.

Let us know if you have any other questions.

Hello! This is an excellent project from a neighboring country! I have a few questions.

You mentioned a one-year free CGPT subscription. After that, will we be able to use our own account, or will we have to pay a subscription through you?

If you decide to use a different AI model in the end, can we still use CGPT instead?

Serbian is supported through CGPT, so is the Serbian language one of the 20 supported languages?

Does water need to be purified or non-mineralized for longer durability?

Have you thought about adding the essential oil feature to your device, perhaps as a way to incorporate aromatherapy, given that it appears to function as a humidifier?

How frequently should you change the water if you‚Äôre not using it for an extended period, such as vacations or weekends off? Is there an option for draining the water from the device?

Thank you so much, and I hope you‚Äôll deliver a great product!

Also, in one video, I noticed that you can switch the device on and off by using a specific phrase? Thanx!

Hi Dragan, thanks for reaching out to us and your interest in FaceAI!

1. We offer a free one-year ChatGPT subscription, and after that period, you‚Äôll have the option to either continue using our subscription for an additional fee or use your own.

2. We‚Äôve tested various AI models (ChatGPT and Claude), and currently, we‚Äôre using ChatGPT due to its high-quality output and frequent updates. We‚Äôve received several inquiries about switching AI models, and our team is actively exploring how we can implement this feature.

3. FaceAI can understand and respond in Serbian, but please note that it‚Äôs not as advanced as it is in English. While FaceAI can handle general conversations in Serbian, more complex topics may not be as accurate. However, we‚Äôre actively working on enhancing its capabilities to support deeper discussions.

4. Great question, you clearly understand the technology! For optimal performance and longevity, it's best to use non-mineralized water in the FaceAI device, as this helps prevent buildup and ensures it works smoothly for longer.

5. Thanks for the suggestion! We've actually considered adding essential oils ourselves and think it's a great idea. We might include it during the campaign!

6. As for water replacement, non-mineralized water can be used for up to two months, while purified water should be changed every 2-3 weeks to maintain optimal performance.

7. Thanks for noting! Yes, we‚Äôve made it easy to activate FaceAI‚Äîjust say ‚ÄúHey FaceAI‚Äù to get started, and deactivate it by saying ‚ÄúBye bye FaceAI.‚Äù

If you have any thoughts or questions, feel free to reach out!

Hi FaceAI team,

I have some questions.

First question is about activation mode :

The device is always listening what it is said by persons around, or is there an activation key as a word, a "Hey SIRI" like phrase, or a button ?

What about confidentiality?

Second question :

Answers are limited by the knowledge of the LLM, or it can be connected to fresh news, as Copilot can do (ie extract main ideas from the speech made the day before by someone at TV news)?

Third question:

For France, shipping is $19. Is VAT included?

That's all for now üòâ.

Hi! Thanks for your interest in FaceAI!

1. There are a few ways to activate FaceAI: 1) Simply say ‚ÄúHey FaceAI,‚Äù 2) Use the app, or 3) Press the button on the device.

2.We take your privacy seriously. We anonymize all data before it's processed by our AI and protect it with advanced encryption and secure transmission. Only essential information is retained for personalization, with all sensitive data encrypted to ensure your privacy is always upheld.

3. FaceAI primarily uses OpenAI's AI model, which is built on LLM technology. As the AI model continuously updates, we expect it to soon support fresh news, making it even more useful as a co-pilot for your day-to-day.

4. Regarding shipping, taxes and duties are included in the shipping fee.

Let us know if you have any other questions.

Best,

The FaceAI Team

Hi! I'm new to Kickstarter and came across your ads. I'm considering getting FaceAI for my daughter and was wondering‚Äîdo you plan to introduce any new colors besides grey? Maybe something more girly?

Hi! Thanks for your interest in FaceAI.

Yes, we‚Äôre working on introducing new color options, so stay tuned! We appreciate your suggestion for more feminine shades and will definitely take it into consideration.

Hi! You mentioned using AI models like OpenAI and Claude. What about subscriptions? Can I use my personal ChatGPT subscription with FaceAI?

Hey, thanks for your interest!

We offer a free one-year ChatGPT subscription, and during this time, we're actively working to expand AI compatibility. Our goal is to enable users to integrate their preferred AI services. While full integration isn‚Äôt confirmed yet, we truly appreciate your feedback and will keep you updated on our progress.

Hi!

Let me just ask you before I decide to back the project entirely.

What is the language model that you‚Äôre using?

How will have the sales support be arranged?

What types of limitations will there be in? What I can ask?

Is it possible to turn off the eyes animation? Can you change colour?

Except for a microphone with other input methods are there like a camera?

Will there be voice recognition meaning that it can understand whether it‚Äôs me or my partner or my children who speaks?

Can it connect to my phone under for arrange schedules and read?

Hi Marcus! Thank you for your interest in FaceAI!

1. FaceAI currently supports over 20 languages. You can easily change the language through the FaceAI app.

2. Sales support will be managed through a dedicated team, primarily via email, to handle inquiries and orders efficiently. If you have any questions, feel free to contact us at faceai.team@gmail.com.

3. You can ask a wide range of questions, including general information, facts, advice, as well as queries related to learning and entertainment. If FaceAI can‚Äôt answer your question, it will ask for clarification or suggest looking up the information online.

4. Yes, you have the option to turn off the eye animation using the app. Only the backlighting in front of the device will remain. The main eye animation is currently yellow-green, but we plan to add new animation options during the campaign. Please stay tuned for updates!

5. The primary input method is a microphone, but we are exploring additional features like a camera and other innovations to enhance FaceAI and make it as useful as possible.

6. We are working on adding highly accurate voice recognition to FaceAI, including the ability to recognize different dialects and accents.This feature requires more time, but we‚Äôre confident we‚Äôll find a solution soon.

7. Kickstarter is just the starting point, and we plan to develop the product further and make it widely available. We truly appreciate any suggestions on how to improve it. To be transparent, FaceAI currently doesn‚Äôt have the ability to connect to your phone for scheduling and reading. However, we do have plans to integrate FaceAI into smart home systems to sync with your devices in the future.

Thanks for your questions! We‚Äôd appreciate any suggestions you have to help us improve. We truly hope you‚Äôll join us on this journey‚Äîyour support means a lot!

Hi!

Thank you for your response!

Sorry I may have been on the clear in my question period. I wonder if it is a CGPT based AI language model or if it‚Äôs a llama or Claude or what type of performance can I expect?

Apologies for any confusion. Right now, we are mainly focusing on ChatGPT for testing, but we are also evaluating other models like Claude to see which works best. This industry is growing at an incredible pace, and in just two months, the market situation could change. We will use the most powerful system available at the time production begins. We will keep you informed about any changes.
