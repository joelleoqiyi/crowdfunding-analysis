Hello,what's the max resolution perceived of the proyector?is only 480p ?because if it comes with dlp DMD can do more resolution?like the 1080p projectors dlp that do almost real 4k?also,In a video I see that the phone can recharge with solar energy,that's true?

Great questions! The WP100 Titan projector has a native resolution of 854×480 but provides clear and sharp visuals for its size. While DLP technology is capable of higher resolutions, this model is optimized for portability and efficiency.

As for solar charging, the phone is compatible with solar charging accessories, but it does not have built-in solar panels. You can use a solar power bank to recharge it on the go!

I know this has been talked about, but not in a way that I understand. I'm in USA. I only know locked phones and unlocked phones. so does this phone take all US carriers or only one or two of them ?

Great question! The WP100 Titan can work with different carriers. However, it supports specific network bands, so while it works with T-Mobile, it may not be fully compatible with Verizon or others that require special certification.

We recommend checking with your carrier to confirm compatibility with the phone’s supported bands!

can you take underwater pics with this phone? how deep can this phone go and still be waterproof? is there any extra lens we can get from you, for super zoom pics? can you download phone memory to external hard drive?

Absolutely! Our Titan camera is perfect for capturing underwater moments—it's waterproof up to 1.5 meters and can handle being submerged for 30 minutes. While we don’t have any extra lenses available right now, you can easily transfer your phone’s memories to an external hard drive. Happy capturing!

thanks for info

Am I able to change the delivery address?

Yes! You will be able to update your delivery address when we send out the Backer Survey after the campaign ends. If your address changes later, you can also contact us directly to update it before shipping begins.

Hi, I read online some concerns regarding the Google Play Store. Is the Google Play Store available on this phone?

Hi Thomas, yes. Google Play Store will be pre-installed in WP100 Titan.

Yes! The Titan supports USB-C video output. If you connect it to a compatible monitor or display using a USB-C cable, the phone's screen will be mirrored to the monitor.

Thank you for your question! The Titan is equipped with an upgraded antenna design compared to the G1, ensuring better signal reception and connectivity stability, especially in remote or challenging environments.

No opportunity to order two of $650?

Thank you for your interest! Currently, Kickstarter limits each backer to one reward tier per pledge. If you’d like to order two units, the easiest way would be to place a second pledge using a different Kickstarter account. We really appreciate your support! At the same time, please send an email to wp100titan@oukitel.com for more instructions.

I just use Kickstarter. I'm not sure if I purchased it or not but didn't give me a delivery address

Thanks for your support! No worries — after the Kickstarter campaign ends, we’ll send out a Backer Survey to collect your delivery address and any other necessary details. If you see your pledge confirmed in your Kickstarter account, you’re all set for now!

Bin mega gespannt habe schon das WP33 pro und bin glücklich, es kann nur besser werden

Vielen Dank für dein Feedback! Es freut uns sehr, dass du mit dem WP33 Pro zufrieden bist. Wir sind sicher, dass der WP100 Titan dich mit seiner riesigen Batterie und vielen weiteren Funktionen noch mehr beeindrucken wird. Wir sind gespannt, wie dir der Titan gefallen wird!

did it type c or hdmi for use with the projector or miracast only?

Hey Jack! Could you clarify your question a bit? Are you interested in learning how to connect the projector to other devices? Let’s make sure we get it all sorted!

yeap!conect the projector to other devicer ..

The Titan projector is built-in and mainly designed to project content directly from the phone itself. However, it also supports wireless screen mirroring, so you can mirror content from other devices (like laptops or tablets) if they support wireless display casting (Miracast, for example).

For wired connection (like connecting a PS station or other HDMI devices), you would need to use a USB-C to HDMI adapter that supports Display Input, but please note that this is not the projector's primary function — it's optimized to work with the phone itself.

If you need this type of feature, we recommend testing with a compatible adapter after you receive the device. Let us know if you need further assistance!

did it come with the type c earphone ?

Hi Jack, thank you for your question! The Titan is compatible with Type-C earbuds; however, the earbuds are not included in the Titan Solo package. If you'd like the earbuds, you may need to choose the Bundle instead.

but i dont see any bundle is inclu the type c earphone?

The Hearwatch in the Bundle is a Bluetooth earbud which can tranform into a smartwatch.

Thank you for your honest feedback! We understand your concerns and really appreciate your input. The Titan stands out with its massive battery, exceptional durability, versatility, and portability. We recommend waiting for feedback from other users once they start using the device, as real-world experience is the best way to gauge the phone’s performance.

We’re confident that it will impress you once you get your hands on it. Thanks again for your valuable thoughts!

Hi. When will you start the delivery? How long will it take to come to France? Am I sure to be delivered? What are my warranty if the good is lost during the shipping? I already had this kind of problems with shipping from Asia.

Thank you for your questions! We plan to start deliveries in early April. The shipping to France usually takes 1 week to 2 weeks.

We ensure that all shipments are tracked and insured to minimize any issues, and we’ll support you through the process if anything goes wrong.

We understand your concerns, and we are committed to making the shipping process as smooth as possible. Thank you for trusting us!

Thank you for your reply

i have a question to the creator, the survey to keep from me the details of shipping address will be sent to me by e-mail or what else?

Thank you for your question! The survey to collect your shipping address will be sent to you via email after the campaign ends. Please keep an eye on your inbox, and make sure to check your spam/junk folder just in case. If you have any further questions, feel free to reach out!

Your trust in us means a lot, and we’ll work hard to ensure the Titan meets your expectations. We appreciate your support and can't wait to deliver an amazing product. All the best, and we hope the Titan lives up to your high hopes!

Thank you for your question! We will be shipping the Titan from overseas warehouses, and in most regions, you should not incur additional duties or taxes.

The Titan offers a massive 33,000mAh battery which makes it a great choice if you're looking for long-lasting power in a rugged phone. The Titan also features advanced durability and additional features like 18 reverse charging and portable hand steap design, making it unique for users who want more than just a standard rugged phone!

Thank you for the comment. The Titan has a side-mounted fingerprint sensor for easy and secure unlocking.

As for flying with the phone, some airlines have specific restrictions regarding large batteries. However, the phone can generally be checked in with luggage. We recommend checking with your airline about their policy regarding carry-on or checked baggage for large lithium-ion batteries.

Currently, Titan does not support USB-C video output. If you need to use video output, you may need to use an HDMI adapter or wireless casting.

Thank you for your question! To confirm whether our Titan can be opened and repaired using only a screwdriver, we need to check with our product team. Please feel free to send your specific request to wp100titan@oukitel.com, and we will get back to you with more detailed information. Thank you for your understanding!

For the projector, possible to connect with other devices e.g. nintendo switch using the hdmi2usb-c converter?

The Titan WP100 supports wireless screen mirroring and has a Type-C port. If your Nintendo Switch or other device supports video output via USB-C, you may be able to use an HDMI to USB-C adapter for projection. However, we recommend testing compatibility with your specific adapter to ensure the best experience. Let us know if you have any other questions!

We understand that eSIM is becoming increasingly popular, and we appreciate your feedback! While the Titan currently does not support eSIM, we are always looking at ways to improve our devices based on customer needs. We will work on it. Thank you for your input!

We truly appreciate your support and understanding! Thanks for being a part of this journey with us!

It has dual SIM, question could memory be expanded by using SD Card?

Hi Hendra, Titan does not support SD card expansion.

Some of the review vids say it has micro sd is that not true ?

The Titan WP100 does not have a microSD card slot for expandable storage. It comes with ample built-in storage of 512GB. If you require more storage, we recommend using cloud storage options. Thank you for your understanding.
