Matt, I backed this because it seemed very interesting. I have backed before. What is difference between this and the previous version?

Dear Gregory,

The main differences between the IVYCABLE P6 and the previous generation IVYCABLE are as follows:

1. **Faster Charging Speed**: The IVYCABLE P6 supports PD60W fast charging, allowing it to quickly charge smartphones, laptops, and other devices that support the PD fast charging protocol, such as gaming consoles. This means that one IVYCABLE P6 can meet the fast charging or standard charging needs of nearly all electronic devices.

2. **Smarter Design**: The IVYCABLE P6 features our proprietary solution. During pass-through fast charging (when devices like smartphones are charged through the IVYCABLE connected to a charger), it functions as a standard charging cable, directly transferring all the power from the charger to the device. Once the device is fully charged, the IVYCABLE P6 then draws 5V (Max. 2.4A) from the charger to recharge its built-in battery until it is fully charged.

3. **More Portable**: The IVYCABLE P6 is lighter and more compact than its predecessor, making it easier to hold or carry in your pocket, providing a more convenient experience.

4. **Multi-functional Design**: The IVYCABLE P6 resembles a standard three-section staff (a traditional Chinese martial arts weapon). In emergency situations, it can be used for self-defense, adding an extra layer of utility.

Thank you once again for your support and for raising such important questions. I hope the above answers provide you with a clearer and more intuitive understanding of the differences between the IVYCABLE P6 and previous products!

Sincerely & B.regards

Matt

Dear Arthur,

Exactly, Ivycable P6 is a power cable of pd60w that built-in a 12W power bank!

Hi there,

Is it possible to remove the lightning adapter as well as the extension cable at any time?

Sure, it is able to be removed from the Ivycable p6 if you don't need it, any time!

hi, I am an iPhone 15 Pro Max. how much can this charge from 0%?

g you can google the battery of you iphone and do the math yourself man.

its 68%

Hi Cindy，

We haven’t conducted actual charging tests with the iPhone 15 Pro Max. However, based on calculations, when fully charged, the ivycable P6 can charge an iPhone 15 Pro Max from 0% to about 60%. Moreover, an iPhone 13 with 60% battery can easily last an entire day of normal use.

Mr.Sebastian, thank you very much for so kindly responds!

Thank you for such a representative question.

When used as a power bank, the Ivycable P6 has a rated capacity of 3000mAh (11.4W), fully complying with airline regulations. Its maximum input and output power are both 5V&2.4A (12W).

This design maximizes the charging efficiency for devices while minimizing energy loss during the boost conversion process.

In passthrough mode (when connected to a wall outlet while charging a device), the Ivycable P6 functions as a fast-charging cable that supports PD 60W (20V & 3A). When fast charging, Ivycable automatically stops charging its built-in battery and directly powers the connected device.

The advantage of this design is that during PD 60W charging, Ivycable does not generate heat, ensuring safety.

I have the other cable that's was like this. What exactly are the differences between them.

It's great by the way I love it.

Very interested in the response to this point!

Hi Clownstrike,

Yes, the Ivycable P6 only has one specification: Type-C male to Type-C female. If an extension cable is needed, the specification must be Type-C female to Type-C male.

Hi! Came across this in a newsletter and thought the idea was so cool. Could i just check when you guys claim 3000mAh does that refer to the effective capacity? Eg some 5k mAh power banks can probably only output effectively 3k due to heat losses etc

Hi Ray，

That’s a very good question! As you’ve noted regarding heat loss, the actual capacity delivered to the phone from the battery will have some level of loss, with the typical conversion rate around 70%. However, depending on the circuit design, the thickness of the PCB copper traces, and the cross-sectional area of the wires, the conversion efficiency can vary. Of course, there are other factors that influence efficiency, so the conversion rate may differ. The rated capacity of Ivycable P6 is 3000mAh, which is its minimum capacity. Based on our actual tests, Ivycable P6 can fully charge an iPhone 12 Mini once. Since the standard capacity of the iPhone 12 Mini is 2227mAh, the conversion efficiency of Ivycable P6 can reach 74%, which is more than sufficient for a day’s worth of outdoor backup power for the phone. Thank you very much for sharing such a professional question here, and once again, thank you for your support of Ivycable P6!

Honestly I have to commend you guys on such a detailed explanation to my concerns. I hope others can see this thread too and to me it’s a sign of clear understanding of the product and actual prototyping and testing, and you are right I would think ~2.2k is sufficient as a backup power source. Hope you have a successful campaign!

I'd need a longer cable, would there be a chance of you making a longer extension cables, or can we use more that one extension cable (daisy chains)??

Oh well, 1m it is then. Could you connect two 1m cables together?

Hi Nicky,

Thank you very much for comment!

1. A 2-meter-long extension cable typically experiences a voltage drop of nearly 0.5V under normal conditions when current is transmitted from one end to the other. If an Ivycable P6 is added in series, which uses PCB copper traces instead of copper wires, the voltage drop will become significantly larger, making it difficult to meet the voltage requirements of the PD protocol.

2. Such a long extension cable can also cause the CC signal handshake and transmission between the charger and the phone or computer to become unstable during PD fast charging. This instability can ultimately result in charging efficiency failing to meet the standards of PD fast charging.

Therefore, it is highly discouraged to use two 1-meter extension cables connected in series!

If you really need a 2-meter-long extension cable, I suggest searching for one that meets the following requirements:

• The conductor is made of 20 AWG pure copper or enameled wire.

• The cable has a shielding layer.

• The Type-C connector features 24 pins.

Such an extension cable can maintain signal integrity over a 2-meter distance and ensure the voltage drop remains within acceptable limits.

For you reference!

Awesome, thankyou so much for this info, really sorry to have been a pain.

My knowledge is sorely lacking where these things go, but now I have a better understanding, and can tell him what to look for.

Is there a strong magnetic connection on each end (connector) to the main unit? The previous cable I backed did not and the ends tend to flop around. Thanks!

Hi Luke,

Thanks for your support! We increased the magnetic force at both ends to solve this problem.
