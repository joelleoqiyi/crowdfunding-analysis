This looks like a great initiative. I’m curious though, if I use a mobile phone for both personal and work, will it be able to differentiate between the two tones?

Hi Michael, thank you for your support! With Twintual, you can create a different profile for each area of your life—work, personal, family, etc.—and connect the channels you use for each.

For example, you might link Gmail, Outlook, LinkedIn, and Slack to your work profile, while your personal profile includes WhatsApp, Instagram, and personal Gmail. This way, your professional messages will stay polished and formal, while casual chats with friends feel natural and personal—just like you’d naturally adjust in real life.

Twintual is trained on how you behave and communicate in each context, ensuring it mirrors your tone, priorities, and style with precision.

Happy to dive deeper if you’re curious!
