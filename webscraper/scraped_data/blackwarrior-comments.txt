Hi Qaz, Black Warrior is the world's first product on Kickstarter.

We have the following advantages:

1: Our original appearance, and we are applying for a patent.

2: We are equipped with the latest version of Google TV, as well as Netflix and Dolby certification.

3: We have 3D naked eye technology.

4: We have better chips that support 3D technology.

Thank you for your support.

Black Warrior

It's been over 15days, and the creator has failed to provide an office tour video. This is undoubtedly a scam project.

As mentioned by Asianboy8969 we need the projector reviewed by @TechBrothersReviews, @ChigzTech & @TheHookUp for a full and unbiased review to justify the confidence of the backers in the projector as there have been no reviews so far.

A lot of people are canceling because there is little evidence that this is a legitimate product. I still recommend to see if you can get one sent out to “Chigz Tech Reviews” and also reach out to “Tech Brothers Reviews” as time has been counting down. A good amount of people will be canceling as this is an expensive purchase for many people and many people have been scammed many times. Please upload a video showing a 360 view around the projector while it is running and get those reviews done as soon as possible. I know I will be canceling if I do not see any progress soon. The review should be up before the product launches or as soon as it launches. You will have more people interested if they know about it in advance. Please move forward with these request as soon as possible.

Hi there,

Thank you for your support and valuable feedback. We are happy to tell you that @TechBrothersReviews

has already received our projector today and will be posting their review very soon.

Regarding the video, we have already included a 360-degree view of the projector in the “demo video” section on the page. Feel free to check it out, and if you need any additional demo videos, please let us know. Please stay tuned for the upcoming Tech Brothers review!

Hi RJ，

Hi, the Black Warrior uses a 6mm diameter screw hole for mounting. Please check the specifications of your existing ceiling mount to see if it is compatible. Let us know if you need further assistance!

Hi Sergio,

You're absolutely right in your observation. The black areas are used to enhance the depth perception and help the visual system focus more on the central content, making the foreground and background appear more distinct.

In certain scenes, especially those with dynamic or strong 3D effects, the 3D experience becomes more pronounced, and objects crossing these black areas will seem to "pop out" more vividly. However, it's important to note that this is not the same as true holographic depth.

We hope this clears things up! Let us know if you have any more questions.

Does the content I watch have to be in a 3D format to watch in 3D or does the projector convert a regular video to a 3D viewable format?

Hi there,

Thank you for your support! For both naked-eye 3D viewing and glasses-based 3D viewing, you'll need to download content in the corresponding 3D format. Unfortunately, the Black Warrior doesn't have the capability to automatically convert regular videos into 3D.

Feel free to reach out if you have more questions!

I am holding onto my pledge until “Tech Brother’s Reviews” is able to put out the review. I reached out to them to confirm that this is a legitimate product, they are currently waiting for the product to arrive and are looking forward to the review as this is a unique product. They said they will be doing a fair review, non bias. I am surprised this company did not reach out reach out to some slightly bigger YouTubers. I don’t trust the big tech reviewers as they lie for sponsorships. I would have liked to see “Chigz Tech Reviews” do a review of this product and I would recommend this company to look into that. He covers low and high end products, always non bias and he puts everything on a rating scale. If this company does not send it out this time, I would recommend them to do this for their next product. And also, have the review done and uploaded as soon as product is launched.

Also, I would like to see a walk around video of the product while projecting the image on the wall or screen, will you be able to do this?

Hi there,

Thank you for your support and for recommending the reviewer! Your feedback is incredibly helpful for our future efforts.

Regarding the walk-around video, we’ll make sure to capture it and send it to you as soon as possible. :)

Hi Antonio,

Thank you for becoming a backer, and we appreciate your support! To answer your question, Black Warrior uses a hybrid light source, combining a monochrome laser with an Osram RGB-LED light to achieve outstanding visual performance. While it's not a triple laser system, this unique combination provides excellent brightness, color accuracy, and overall image quality.

If you have any further questions, feel free to reach out. We're here to help!

I have some scar tissue from >$1500 USD lost to recent KS projects that were scams or failed to launch, so I entirely support the questions by Lucas to get more transparency on the actual assembly location/any further details in HK.

My question is specifically about the DMD/4K expectation, as that's my background.

Your FAQ states that the system uses a 0.47" DMD chip, which a reasonable person might thing comes from Texas Instruments (but no vendor is specified).

In the FAQ the level of detail is minimal, and there's a specific statement:

"They have a micromirror array size of 1920x1080, meaning 1080p is their native resolution."

I am not sure we have clear documentation of the optical path - so if this is the TI DLP471TP chip then I would understand that 4K is claimed.

But using a 1080p chip as the starter, it doesn't matter how many lenses etc. are put in front of it - the resolution does not improve.

So, would the project team please post useful/clear details about exactly what chipset is in use and how it supports 4K displays?

Because TBH I can't find it - not saying it's not there. but I looked pretty hard.

Looking forward to your update.

It's been over two weeks, and the creator has failed to provide an office tour video. This is undoubtedly a scam project.

Lucas my stomach hurts. Bro unpinned the thread after your comment.

Hi there,

Lucas pledged our project with only HK$100 but has made questionable comments, which raises reasonable doubts about his true intentions. While we welcome all comments, we have reasons to suspect that he might be a competitor rather than a genuine backer. Regardless, we remain committed to delivering on our promises and appreciate the continued support from our real backers.

I can't find the office tour mentioned in their last update. Making such a video should be simple—it would take less than an hour. Also, I noticed in their recent assembly video that the PCB has a TOUMEI logo, which matches the one used in their "Toumei X6 TV Projector." Have they simply redesigned the casing and used other components while presenting this as their own design?

Hi Lucas,

TOUMEI is a professional projector manufacturer and one of our trusted partners. The recent assembly video showcases the Black Warrior’s assembly and testing, provided by the TOUMEI factory. As for originality, the Black Warrior is based on our own design vision, focusing on a cost-effective home entertainment projector with high-quality audio and visual performance, plus added features like KTV. It’s a product of our team’s creativity and effort, not just a rebranding.

The Black Warrior offers dual 3D viewing options, superior audio and visual quality, and seamless integration with the Google TV ecosystem. It provides versatile projection functions for a customizable, cinematic experience—all at an affordable price.

We hope this clears things up, and we appreciate your continued support! Feel free to reach out with any further questions.

Hi Anuwat,

To clarify, Black Warrior has Google TV (GTV) as an integrated app within the main launcher, where you can log in with your Google account. It works just like any other GTV-enabled device.

Black Warrior will automatically update over the internet, so you’ll always have the latest features, including updates from Google for GTV.

We’ve also included a demo of the GTV login page here https://youtu.be/XSvCXNbqpiU?si=d_BpzWE4wO4bfHx7.

Let us know if you have any more questions!

This appears to be a potential scam project. The creator promised an office tour video weeks ago.

Hi Qaz,

1：Regarding VRR support, we will consult the solution provider and get back to you as soon as possible.

2：Black Warrior supports up to 120Hz MEMC motion compensation.

3：Black Warrior does not support filmmaker mode yet. But there is a custom mode. You can customize some parameters to support your needs.

Thank you for your support.

Black Warrior

Could you describe further how the naked eye 3D and the glasses 3D differs. What display format is needed to actually use these features., IMAX 3D? Just checked some well used streaming services and none really had any 3D content from what I could find.

I second Lucas on this one. Would be very valuable with some factory footage and also some footage from your office if possible. It would really build the trust. A video showing an actual Black Warrior being assembled would be gold!

Hi Matt,

Thank you for your valuable suggestion! We agree that sharing behind-the-scenes footage would be a great way to build trust and transparency. We’re currently working on providing a video tour that includes both factory and office footage, along with some exciting content showing the assembly process of the Black Warrior. Stay tuned for an update soon!

Thanks again for your support!

I cannot locate the office tour that was mentioned in your last update. Creating such a video should be a quick task—no more than an hour. Additionally, I noticed in your recent assembly video that the PCB bears a TOUMEI logo, which is identical to the one used in their "Toumei X6 TV Projector". Have you merely redesigned the casing and utilized their components while presenting this as your original design?

Hey, I'm a backer but is considering removing my backing based on some of the uncertainties pointed out by Lucas. If there is a reson not to address some of his question in the open maybe you can send a DM with some answers?

Some thing that would really give weight to you campaign is if you send a unit to some third party reviewer like "The Hook Up" or similar? Would this be possible?

Is there any other way you can prove beyond no doubt that this product is real and not just a scam?

Hi Matt, thanks for your thoughtful suggestions!

We’d be happy to arrange a virtual tour for Lucas if they are available, where they can explore the factory and experience the Black Warrior firsthand. It’s a great way for our backers to see the behind-the-scenes process, and we really appreciate your interest in being part of this journey!

One of the trusted reviewers is @TechBrothersReview. We’ll be sure to keep you updated on when their review is live and share the link with all our backers.

Thanks again for your support—together, we’ll make this project even better!

Just to clarify with a virtual I ment that you just film the factory and office and describe a bit with no Lucas involved. He if ofc welcome to :)

Hi Anuwat, thanks for your question!

While we aren't a direct partner listed on the Android TV website, to enhance the entertainment experience, Black Warrior has collaborated with an Android TV partner and is licensed to use their module. The Google TV (GTV) functionality is built directly into the Black Warrior projector.

Feel free to reach out if you have any more questions!

Could you please specify which Android TV partner you worked with?

Hi Lucas, thanks for your question!

Our GTV and Dolby Vision partners are Shenzhen Skyworth Digital Technology Co. Ltd. They provide the modules that enable these advanced features in the Black Warrior, ensuring an exceptional viewing experience.

Feel free to reach out if you have any more questions!

Hi Qaz!

Thanks for reaching out! Black Warrior uses a module from a certified Dolby Vision provider, ensuring full compatibility with Dolby Vision content.

Feel free to reach out if you have more questions!

Using certified Dolby Vision components does not automatically make the final product Dolby Vision certified. The entire projector must go through Dolby's certification process and meet their strict requirements. Manufacturers need to obtain proper licensing and certification from Dolby for the complete product, not just individual components.

Hi Creator,

Here is the link for your reference.

https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/oil-mufee/mufee-home-smart-essential-oil-and-infusion-oil-maker/comments

You are exhibiting the same concerning behaviors as that creator:

1. Misrepresenting team location

2. Creating fake accounts to speak for themselves

3. Ignoring backers' questions

4. Refusing to share creator and company details

5. Failing to provide promised third-party reviews

As you can see, I'm not alone in opposing scams on Kickstarter, particularly when they involve false claims about being based in Hong Kong.

As a Hong Kong resident, I strongly oppose those who falsely claim to be from here to defraud people. These scams damage the reputation of all legitimate Hong Kong creators. That's why I keep requesting your Hong Kong office address—to verify your team is actually based here. If you are genuinely from Hong Kong, you would know that you have the legal right to deny office entry to anyone and can call the police to remove unwanted visitors. So what is your next excuse for not sharing your office location?

Lucas thank you for what your doing , lately too many questionable projects here unfortunately

Hi Omar, The N1 Ultra projector released by JMGO in 2020 is 4000 ANSI Lumens. You can check their Campaign page again. Thank you for your support.

Hi Omar,

Thank you for your support and great question!

We do plan to introduce stretch goals that may include a battery brick, but due to shipping and regional restrictions, we may not be able to offer it to all backers. As a result, the battery brick option is still under consideration. In the meantime, we recommend that backers who are interested in a portable battery solution consider purchasing a compatible one themselves. If we move forward with this stretch goal, we will provide more details during the campaign.

Thanks again for your interest and support!

Since the company is new, there isn't much history available from the creator. Why does the creator refuse to share their background and company address? This lack of transparency creates confusion among backers. As other backers have noted, we all understand the risk of not receiving anything from creators, which is why we need to verify details ourselves. Successful projects typically do their best to build confidence. Only scam projects make excuses—especially concerning the absence of third-party reviews, creator background or LinkedIn profiles, and basic company information.

Hi Lucas? Thank you for changing your name again. I just want to tell you all our public information is in accordance with Kickstarter community rules.

If you really want to support us, we welcome you. If you blindly post repeated comments to mislead other supporters, it will only make everyone think that your purpose is not pure.

Are you in China? If you are interested in our projector, please send us a private message. We will take you to experience the black warrior projector and visit our production factory.

Hi Anuwat!

Thank you for your inquiry. Here are the details you requested:

RAM: 2GB

Storage (ROM): 32GB

Google TV Version: The projector runs on Android TV 12, the latest version of Google TV.

If you have any more questions, feel free to ask!

32GB ROM? Are you sure about that? This storage wouldn't be used for storing apps. I found the same product on Taobao (China's Amazon), and they made the exact same mistake in their product details. This appears to be a translation error from their webpage that you've copied directly into your answer. I'm pretty sure you are just repackaging this product and attempting to scam people's money here.
