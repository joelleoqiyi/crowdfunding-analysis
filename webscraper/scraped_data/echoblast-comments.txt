What exactly is the “Launch day ECHOKILLER” mentioned in The Soundmaster pledge level?

Hi Adam. Thanks for your message.

It's a white device. The regular color is the traditional white.

Best, O.

Correcting: The regular color is the traditional black (not white).

Best.

Total blast from the past, what a great idea. Hope it works as well as it looks and sounds. What’s the max length of sound you can have per file/button?

Hey Zack. Thanks for your kind words. We'll make our best to make this a great project.

Regarding your question, after running some tests with the dev team, we established the max length of the sound to be 5 seconds, and the sound to be played on a loop if the button is still pressed.

Have a blast!

Ok that’s great. Best of luck with the campaign!
