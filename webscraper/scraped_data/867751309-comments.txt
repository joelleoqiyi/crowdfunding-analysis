Hiï¼Œ

You can check this link : www.huakeyixun.com

This is our company's website, although not very detailed. But we mainly do offline OEM/ODM

This looks so much like a scam. When I Google "NPadF OEM and ODM", no website comes up. Only a Facebook group that was created in January, and a FB page that created the group. Also, they are based where a lot of the scams come from.

So, where is the website and social media you have been operating for years? What are your company address and registration details?

In the past, we mainly served long-term cooperation with B-end customers, and our official website was not the main customer acquisition channel. That is why our official website and social media matrix are still being improved. This is our first time targeting the consumer market.

Thank you for your understanding.

You are repeating yourself. Again, you are saying that your website was in existence but not used much, but as I said, the evidence shows your website was not in existence before January 15 this year. (The domain was registered on 15 January.) Likewise, I cannot find any social media for you that existed prior to this year.

Lets get it

Thank you so much for your support.

You will lose your money.
