According to the lifetime model provided by Coherent scientists, with operation at our calibrated environment temperature (<40℃), the expected lifetime of the laser will reach 15,000 hours. Our reliability laboratory will continue to update the laser’s operational lifetime data. Of course, we welcome you to join us in testing this data, and if needed, we can recommend the necessary testing equipment.",

Still, you have a lot of units to make, maybe approaching 20 units per 5 day work week. You mentioned you \"entered the bulk material procurement stage\". Do you have any pictures or videos of raw materials inventory and assembly line processes? Would be great to see some pictures of the start to finish and getting ready to ship.

On the other hand, because the X1 Pro uses a heat fusion principle during cleaning, the paint on the sheet metal carbonizes and releases a large amount of dust, which is more effective on the metal surface. This is a limitation based on materials. Some specific coatings, such as high-temperature cured oxide layers, are difficult to remove. The third limitation is the cleaning depth. If the corrosion is too deep, repeated cleaning or mechanical grinding may be needed during use.",

With the X1-Pro, is it possible to not use the wire feeder and to add material manually, like you do with TIG welding? Seeing some of the videos, the ability to remove the wire before the laser is stopped could be a better way to ensure a clean start and finish to the welds.",

If you are an experienced welder, you can choose not to use the wire feeder and instead manually feed the wire to fill the weld. but, we will still equip you with a wire feeder. The purpose of including the wire feeder is to help more welding enthusiasts achieve cleaner, more beautiful welds. Please note that regardless of whether you use the wire feeder, always use the same type of wire as the welding material.",
