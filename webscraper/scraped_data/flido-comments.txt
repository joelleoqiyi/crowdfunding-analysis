any updates yet?

Since you can’t book the yearly subscription multiple times, I tipped you 3 dollars because I actually wanted to buy it 4 times annually - for me and my 3 flatmates. Hope this works that way too. Love your idea ✌️

Thank you so much for your generous tip and support! We truly appreciate you subscribing on behalf of your flatmates. Once our app is live, we'll send you your codes and look forward to your feedback and suggestions. Thanks again for supporting CalGPT!

Will it be also available for Android?

Yes, we plan to launch on Android starting March 8, but due to Play Store approval, it may be delayed by a few days. We’ll keep everyone updated!

Avaible in german ?

Thank you for asking! Germany is actually one of the first countries we’ll support with localized language and food/fitness databases. Over time, we’ll continue expanding worldwide to ensure everyone can use CalGPT, no matter where they live. We appreciate your support and can’t wait to bring CalGPT to you!
