Could you please post a video of the feature Write & Transcribe?

Thanks for your interest in the Write & Transcribe feature! We’re currently working on finalizing this functionality, and once it’s fully refined, we’ll be sharing a detailed video demonstration to showcase exactly how it works.

Stay tuned—we’ll post updates and videos as soon as they’re ready! Let us know if you have any other questions in the meantime.

What kind of refills will this be using? Standard D1 refills?

Hello Nico, The AI Smart Pen is designed to be both high-tech and practical, and it will use standard D1 refills, making it easy to replace when needed. This ensures compatibility with widely available refills, so you can keep writing without any hassle.

Let us know if you have any other questions—we’re happy to help!

Can you post more videos of the features? I'm interested in the hand written notes to digital

We’re actively working on the handwritten notes-to-digital feature and will share updates as soon as it’s ready. While this feature is still in development, we’re excited about its potential and committed to making it a key part of the AI Smart Pen.

In the meantime, we’ll be posting more videos and live demonstrations once we finalize our final product version. Stay tuned for updates, and thanks for your interest and support!
