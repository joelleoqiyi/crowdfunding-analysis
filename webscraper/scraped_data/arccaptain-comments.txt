Alan this will be my first arc captain how do you like your other 3 comparable to miller/esab

Just backed this. My son and I are starting a project truck. Hoping it's up to the tasks we are going to put it through. I'm confident it should do nicely after seeing alot of positive feedback about the other arccaptian welders.

Are there any updates? Issues that have arisen etc?

Already paid for one, but I'm second-guessing myself. First off, the duty cycle. They say it's got a 205A output, but I've seen similar machines where the duty cycle is way lower than advertised. Heard from others that this brand's welders have issues with overheating and wire feeding problems. I know it's cheap, but if they're cuttin' corners on the important stuff, this thing might not handle real work. Anyone else worried about the quality?

Hi there! Thank you for your support. Please be assured that our MIG 205MP undergoes rigorous quality testing and has demonstrated excellent performance in wire feeding and overheating resistance. Despite its affordability, our machines are built to handle demanding work, and we proudly back our quality with a two-year warranty.

Thanks for getting back 2 me. I appreciate it, but I still have a few things on my mind. First off, how easy is it to replace parts on this machine? Also, I noticed it took a few days for your team to reply to my initial message. I‚Äôm wondering if being a company based in china might sometimes lead to delays in communication. I need to feel confident that I can get the support I need when I need it, especially if something goes wrong with the machine.

If i want to improve ground wire what is the actual size of ground wire for welding?

Hi Stephane! Regarding your question on improving the ground wire, our ground clamp interface features a DINSE 10-25 connector, ensuring a secure and reliable connection for your welding needs.

But i had seen comments and review that some welders had found the size of ground to small for long working shot . They said that they had improve this by using a bigger cable for ground...

I‚Äôm wondering about that myself

Hi! We recommend using an air compressor that can provide 4-5 CFM at 60 PSI.

I just backed this project. I was wondering what kind of warranty comes with the machine? If it breaks down with in 2 or 3 years will we get a replacement? If so Would it be n updated version or the original kickstarter version. I only ask because I got the yeswelder mp200. And got burned with that one. I burned out 2 with in 2.5 years. And now I don't have a welder.

Hi Chris! Thank you for backing our project! Our ARCCAPTAIN MIG 205MP comes with a 2-year warranty, ensuring reliable support in case of any issues.

I bypassed the big three welding companies and backed this project instead. Hopefully I made the right decision...only time will tell

Can the 205MP be used wth a water-cooled TIG torch?

Hi Noah! ARCCAPTAIN MIG 205MP does not support a water-cooled TIG torch.

Backed this welder solely from Watching Jo Daddy's Garage. Fyi.

Super excited to upgrade my current flux/mig welder. Great reviews (mostly) on the various social media sources so I was happy to purchase the 205mp. Worried about this n process as it's a first for me but I expect everything will be taken care of. Thank you and look forward to when this unit arrives at my door to put it to use.

Thanks!

I paid the $50 for early access that's supposed to include welding gloves and 500 coins. I went to Kickstarter and purchased the welder and can't find how I get my benefits of the $50 early purchase. The site wants to charge for the gloves. How do I get the free gloves?

Hi Eric! No worries, your VIP refund will be issued after the campaign ends. You will also receive 500 WeldCoins and a free pair of welding gloves as part of your benefits.

The welding gloves are listed as add-ons on Kickstarter for purchase, but your free pair is already included. If you‚Äôd like additional gloves, let us know and we‚Äôll take note of it.
