Can I buy 2?

Can purchase additional batteries if the battery efficiency decreases later?

Now that its been revealed that infinite battery life is a removable batteryâ€¦ does the specified <50g weight include the battery?

yup!

Video of their battery mechanism.

I have questions with how long it takes a single battery will last and how long it takes to charge. You're just promoting the ease of swapping batteries in all your recent instagram videos

Hello, hereâ€™s the answer to your first question:

Single battery capacity: 340mAh

Endurance at 1K polling rate: Approx. 43 hours

Endurance at 8K polling rate: Approx. 17 hours (2.4G)

How about second question lol

Hey guys!

I own a Razer Viper Mini SE, can't wait to compare it against yours ;) I have a question though - will we be able to add AM SilkGlass Gaming Mouse Pad (and probably glass skates?) as an addon?

Thanks!

Thanks for backing us!

And yes we do plan on getting the mouse pad on as an add-on.

But we are still figuring out the shipping fees for the pad at this point. If you want to buy the mouse pad, you can get on our official website to pre-order it. Here is the link. Or you can join our discord for more updates on the pad.

Thank you guys for the prompt reply! I've seen the mat on your website and I am already on your Discord. But it would be nice to have a mat as an add-on to ship together and save a bit on shipping costs ;)

Itâ€™s a patented design. While not rocket science, weâ€™ve put in extra effort to ensure a smooth and instant charging experience with no additional worries. Plus, itâ€™s included in the package at no extra cost. Weâ€™ll definitely disclose the details a few days before the campaign ends.

Hi, please check out the product page update about how we made it. We will also wrap up a KS update soon.

Can't wait for another AM product :)

Hi buddy. Thanks for backing us!

KS will contact you right after the campaign ends and ask for your address.

Just keep an eye out for the email and you should be fine.

Please

I haven't filled in the address yet so how can the product be sent to me?

Oops I find the information.My bad,itâ€™s my first time to use the app.Looking forward to holding the mouse.

No worries. Just keep an eye out for the email from KS right after the campaign and you should be fine.

Does it also come in different colors?

Ah got it. Thanks!

*Big upps

Hey buddy, thanks for backing us! And welcome to the crew! Join our discord for more updates and discussions!

Looking forward to this!

Thank you for supporting our early bird offer!

How come I didnâ€™t receive the email confirmation for pledging the early bird yet?

Hi Andrew,

Please take a look of KS FAQ: https://help.kickstarter.com/hc/en-us/articles/115005126774-Where-can-I-keep-track-of-my-pledges and https://help.kickstarter.com/hc/en-us/articles/115005066393-How-do-I-pledge

If you didn't reach a "Thank you!" confirmation page and/or you didn't receive a confirmation email (title: "You just backed [Project Name]"), it's likely that your pledge did not go through and you may want to try again.

Check spam: If you don't receive a confirmation email, check your spam folder.

Instead of Infinite Battery Life, can it also be used with a regular C type port charger?

Hi there, weâ€™ll be spilling all the details about the infinite battery life soonâ€”promise, itâ€™s worth the wait! ðŸ˜‰ Stay tuned!

how Infinite Battery work?

Hey buddy. We are currently conducting final tests on that. We will disclose everything about the infinite battery life in about 10 days. Please stay tuned.

What's the scroll wheel like? Will it have infinite/free scroll?

Thatâ€™s an ambitious idea, LOL! You can check out the scroll wheel in the 'Top-Tier Hardware Stack, As You Expect' section of the product page, where we've included a picture. Weâ€™d be more than happy to have you join our Discord to discuss more ideas with the community!

I cant wait to get my hand on this thing <3

Oh buddy I saw you in the channel lol! Welcome to the crew!
