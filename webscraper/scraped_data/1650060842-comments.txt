I had been looking for a project like this for a long time. Well done, E-PISTEME! I'm really looking forward to getting my hands on the E-Tellurion!

It's an amazing project that encourages children, young people, and even adults to explore the world of STEM while learning about astronomy in a fully interactive way. It's a fantastic way to spark curiosity and foster scientific thinking. Plus, I love that it's not just for kids, anyone with an interest in space can enjoy it and learn a lot. Don't hesitate to support this initiative!
