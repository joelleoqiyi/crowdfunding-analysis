Congratulations on your kickstarter hope to get a unit. btw you have reached the next stretch goal... also another update would be good :D

Hallo kann man mit den Laser auch im Freien schweißen? Grüße Alfred

Just wanted to say, I'm super stoked to get it and start my projects, but I need to know when can I get it? From what I understand, it's supposed to ship in april, but where exactly is this coming from? Is it shipped from somewhere in the US, or is it coming all the way from china？If it's from china, I'm a bit worried about the shipping. I mean, it's not cheap, and I want to make sure it gets here safe and sound. Do you guys have some kind of insurance or extra care for the transport? I hate to get it all the way here and have something break during shipping.

From looking at other peoples comments they said April-July

Hi Will

We are fully focused on production right now. Once we schedule the logistics, we will update you with the estimated delivery date. Our plan is to complete all shipments between April and July, following the order sequence of our backers. Once shipped, we will promptly share the tracking numbers for you to check. Our packaging includes foam padding with separators, a waterproof bag covering the product, and reinforced corner protection to ensure safe transport.

Thank you

Could you briefly explain the difference for the types of lenses? I'm interested in adding some to my pledge, but would like to know better the difference between them and pros and cons, please.

Hi Gabriel

The laser protective lens is designed to prevent dust and splashes from damaging the focusing lens, making it an essential consumable part. It is typically made of quartz with a coated surface.

The focusing lens concentrates parallel light beams into a high-energy density point to achieve a powerful laser beam. It is usually a convex lens made of quartz or silicon.

The collimating lens shapes divergent light into a parallel beam, optimizing beam quality. It is generally made of quartz or crystal.

Thank you

Do you really expect ro be able to deliver in april? That seems unreasonable.

Hi Ian

We plan to complete all shipments between April and July, following the order in which backers placed their orders. Once shipping is complete, we will promptly share tracking numbers so everyone can check their shipment status.

Thank you

Have the units a PFC build in? What is the life time of the Fiber Laser in real condition because it gets hot in the inside of the Unit?

Hi Heuboda

We have consolidated feedback from our R&D engineers, and here is our final response to your questions:

1. At the current stage, the X1/X1 Pro does not have a built-in PFC due to its high cost. However, the power fluctuation at normal temperatures is minimal—only 5% between 15°C and 35°C. This can be optimized by adjusting the optical path.

2. The lifespan testing of the laser source used in the X1/X1 Pro is still ongoing. So far, 5,000 hours of testing have shown that power degradation remains within 5%. According to the lifespan model provided by Coherent scientists, when operating under our specified environmental conditions (<40°C), the estimated lifespan is around 15,000 hours. Our reliability lab will continue updating this data. Of course, we also welcome you to conduct your own testing. If needed, we can recommend the necessary testing equipment.

3. We have implemented a comprehensive heat dissipation design, covering key optical components, the laser source, the output gun, and the device’s airflow system.

• First, for the core semiconductor laser chip, we use high-temperature-resistant laser chips, high thermal conductivity heat sinks, and alloy solder to ensure effective heat dissipation and reliability.

• Second, the laser source adopts a combination of air cooling and phase-change cooling, with thermal simulation and optimization conducted using FLOTHERM XT software.

• Third, the laser gun head features an internal airflow cooling design, where high-pressure gas removes heat generated during operation.

• Lastly, the overall system uses an independent airflow design to prevent high-temperature failures caused by insufficient air intake.

We welcome any further technical discussions. Feel free to leave us a message if you have any other questions.

Thank you for your kind answer again!

You’re very welcome! If you have any further questions, feel free to leave us a message anytime.

Hi, is the X1 Pro, CE certified? Than you!

Hi Heuboda

Yes, our X1 Pro and X1 has obtained CE, FDA, FCC, and all necessary certifications. We have updated the information in the “Certificate” section on our campaign page, where you can click the images to view the detailed documents. For your convenience, you can also access them directly via the following link:https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1b8axmK0vLR-TNLA3vrHhFQnv5t3_HhZ_?usp=sharing

If you have any questions, please feel free to reach out to us—we’re happy to help!

Thank you

Thank you for your answer(s)!

You’re welcome! Welcome aboard!

Congratulations on ordering over 1000 devices here on Kickstarter.

Unfortunately, I have little knowledge about lasers and safety. Eye protection is particularly important. I assume that the laser safety glasses cannot withstand a direct laser beam of 700W. But what maximum power of a reflected laser beam should you expect in the worst case? What value do you assume there?

In the worst case scenario, can the laser safety glasses block this reflected beam and protect the eyes and if so, for how long?

Hi

The light reflection from laser welding does not directly enter the safety glasses. The purpose of the laser protective eyewear is to prevent damage from the brightness of the laser on the workpiece and any splashes during welding. The laser safety glasses we provide have a protection level of OD7, with a light-blocking effect of 10^-7, fully meeting the laser protection standards of various countries. Therefore, as long as you wear the safety glasses correctly during the operation of the equipment, there will be no harm to your eyes. I hope this answer addresses your question. If anything is unclear, feel free to ask us anytime!

Thank you

Are the culminating and focusing lens available as an add-on because they are considered consumable items for the X1Pro, if not why what are they used for?

Hi Z

The focusing lens and collimating lens are available as add-ons and are considered consumables. However, with proper usage, they typically do not wear out quickly—usually requiring replacement every six months to a year. But if the welding gun is accidentally dropped, they may get damaged immediately.

The main function of the focusing lens is to focus the laser beam onto a specific working area, concentrating the laser energy at the welding point. By precisely focusing the laser, welding accuracy and efficiency can be improved.

The role of the collimating lens in the laser welding gun is to convert the divergent laser beam into a parallel beam, reducing the divergence during beam propagation. The collimating lens optimizes the laser beam quality, which benefits subsequent focusing and energy transfer.

Thank you

I would ideally like to cut 5 mm plain sheet steel with myx1 pro, i know its the top end of its capablity on the x1 pro but Joshua managed it on his demo machine so if our versions are just as powerfull should also be possible but what id like to know from your cutting tests for clean cuts done on a CNC so there is no shake and consistent speed, what would you estimate cutting speed for 4mm and 5mm as in MM per Min, for carbon steel plate, if you have any real life test figures thats great

Thankyou

Hi David

The cutting speed is calculated by dividing the length you need to cut by the cutting time. For 5mm carbon steel with a 700W laser, we estimate the speed to be around 500-1000mm/min. Oxygen cutting speed needs to be calculated based on your specific cutting requirements and materials. Additionally, the quality of the cut you’re aiming for will also affect the cutting speed. In some cases, we may also opt for a secondary cut to achieve the desired result.

Thank you

If i can cut 5mm thick carbon steel at a speed of 500mm per min on my cnc table with the x1pro and acheive a nice smooth edge that youd expect from laser cut parts then im more than happy, ive seen it can provide great results welding 5mm steel to so will fit my needs perfect, I cant wait to get my hands on it and shoot some videos in my shop and on the cnc to really show what can be done with it and send them over to you for promo material, when people can see real life results from an end user can be more impressive than company videos if they can see the videos are unedited and not speeded up gives potential buyers more confidence in what they see and will help boost sales. Do you have any detailed drawings with the gun body x,y, and z measurments so i can design a clamp that can be bolted to cnc to hold the gun square and secure

Hi David

Thank you so much for your support and for being willing to help share and promote our product! We really appreciate that.

But at the moment, since our campaign is still ongoing, our primary focus is ensuring the successful delivery of all backers’ devices. For this reason, we are not yet sharing detailed dimensions of the device and its components. And once you receive your X1 Pro, you are welcome to make any modifications as needed. If you require specific parameters at that time, feel free to reach out, and we will be happy to assist you!

Thank you for your understanding.

Hi. I would like to hear a confirmation from xphotonics that the recently announced increase of 20% tariffs over products imported from China to USA will NOT affect the final price of the X1 pro, meaning that xphotonics will cover this additional cost and will not add any extra fee to the buyers.

Thank you.

Wow I’m truly impressed!

Thank you xphotonics!

Thank you for the prompt and clear answer ! 👍

You’re welcome! If you have any further questions, feel free to leave us a message anytime.

Hi Navid

Based on our bodywork cleaning tests, the maximum width of our cleaning mode is 17mm. On the other hand, because the X1 Pro uses a heat fusion principle during cleaning, the paint on the sheet metal carbonizes and releases a large amount of dust, which is more effective on the metal surface. This is a limitation based on materials. Some specific coatings, such as high-temperature cured oxide layers, are difficult to remove. The third limitation is the cleaning depth. If the corrosion is too deep, repeated cleaning or mechanical grinding may be needed during use.

Thank you

How deep is too deep?

Hi Monday

The cleaning effect and depth vary depending on the material and surface condition, so we cannot provide a specific cleaning depth.

Thank you

I have made my pledge for an X1-Pro bundle and looking forward to you fulfilling this in the coming months. With the X1-Pro, is it possible to not use the wire feeder and to add material manually, like you do with TIG welding? Seeing some of the videos, the ability to remove the wire before the laser is stopped could be a better way to ensure a clean start and finish to the welds.

Hi Christopher

Thank you for your support! If you are an experienced welder, you can choose not to use the wire feeder and instead manually feed the wire to fill the weld. but, we will still equip you with a wire feeder. The purpose of including the wire feeder is to help more welding enthusiasts achieve cleaner, more beautiful welds. Please note that regardless of whether you use the wire feeder, always use the same type of wire as the welding material.

Thank you

Subject: Automated Cutting Support – Laser Welding Station

Hello,

I recently ordered a laser welding station and was wondering if you plan to offer a support for automated cutting, as shown in your presentation video.

If not, could you guide me toward a suitable solution?

Thank you in advance for your response.

Best regards,

Hi Sitbon

You are asking about the CNC cutting functionality. Regarding this, after the campaign ends and delivery is complete, we will provide the relevant communication signal documentation. we will also publish tutorial videos on our official YouTube channel. If after receiving the product and watching the video, the video does not resolve your issue, feel free to contact our after-sales support. Our after-sales team will provide you with a more detailed solution.

Thank you!

I am not technical enough to build my own cutting machine. Could you already guide me towards a solution?

Hi Sitbon

We are currently fully focused on ensuring timely delivery. But once you receive the product and watch the tutorial videos, if you still have any unresolved issues, we will arrange for an R&D expert to assist you.

Thank you for your understanding!

How about a Monday morning status of the project from the xlaser team? Any milestones taking place this week, anyyhing interesting to share about what you're working on this week?

Hi Z

Our latest milestone is that our campaign has exceeded $2,000,000, successfully unlocking welding protective gloves for every Backer. Next, when the crowdfunding amount exceeds $3,000,000, we will unlock the welding protective mask. Also, we have officially released FDA, FCC, and CE certifications. All certification details have been uploaded to the “Certificate” section on our campaign page, where you can click on the images to view the full certificates.

Meanwhile, we have already entered the bulk material procurement stage, ensuring timely delivery. This week’s milestone is that 5 units of our machine are currently undergoing the final functionality tests — an essential step before we move into mass production. We are currently transitioning from small batch production to the large-scale delivery phase. Our team is working tirelessly to ensure product deliveries stay on schedule.

Again, thank you for your support!

Nice, that was a good update, thanks for posting it

You're welcome!

Checking up on availability of the X1Pro manuals. You indicated they would be available soon

Thanks

Hi Dwigh

Thank you for reaching out! The X1Pro manuals are currently undergoing detailed review. They will be available soon, and we appreciate your patience.

Thank you

You have recently posted a comment that states the X1 Pro has a weight of 35kg but in your specifications table it states the weight as 19kg. Please explain?

Hi RishP

35kg is the weight of our product including packaging, but the weight of the X1 Pro machine along with the welding gun is 19kg.

Thank you

Can you tell me if holding the gun at 90 degrees to the material being cut ok or if it would damage the laser source due to back feed? If so what’s the minimum angle

Sen

Hi Senthuren

The impact of vertical or angled positioning on the laser source is not significant. The material has a much greater effect on the laser source. For the best cutting results, it’s still recommended to maintain a vertical position. When the laser is at a vertical or slightly tilted angle, the energy density on the cutting surface is higher, so the reflected energy is smaller and won’t cause damage. However, for highly reflective materials, such as copper and aluminum, it’s recommended to use appropriate parameters and gases, with high-purity nitrogen being the best choice.

Thank you

How are customer service and spares going to be provided in the UK?

Hi Mark

If your machine encounters any issues, you can describe the specific situation to us, and our technical team will conduct a remote diagnosis. We have professional after-sales personnel to provide you with the necessary service and support. Regarding spare parts, we have started collaborating with localized partners in various regions, and once the partners begin handling after-sales services, we will store spare parts locally to ensure a quick response to your needs. Our after-sales team will do its best to help resolve any issues you encounter.

Thank you

Dear XPhotonics,

Thank you for your reply. I well understand the need for a full repair & maintenance support system. I am heartened by your proposed use of remote diagnostics, even if this actually requires a man in the loop. That is a much more efficient system than starting with a 'return to base'. I am an electrical engineer and would welcome all and any engineering information.

Kind regards

Mark

Thank you again for joining our journey.

Hi regarding the X1 pro,

1. what output connector being used on the on the fiber laser source output to the gun. Is it standard QBH ?

2. What handheld gun are you using. Can a SUP series gun be connected to the output?

3.in terms of cooling is is direct forced air or any refrigerant or heat exchangers being used. If it’s direct forced air, are there and maintenance needed at certain intervals?

Thank you

Hi Senthuren

1.Yes, the X1 Pro uses a standard QBH connector.

2.Our equipment is equipped with a dedicated air-cooled handheld laser welding gun. The machine cannot be directly connected to other models of guns and must use the corresponding model.

3.For cooling, we use a forced air cooling system. The Coherent chip we use has excellent heat resistance, and combined with a unique heat dissipation system, the machine will not automatically shut down under normal environmental temperatures. If the ambient temperature exceeds 40°C (104°F), the device may need to shut down for cooling to prevent damage to internal electronic components. Generally, as long as you use the equipment under normal environmental conditions and within the specified operational and environmental guidelines, it can operate continuously without requiring special maintenance.

Thank you for your support!

Hi there ! Are there any external control interfaces that connect to CNC machines? The X1Pro’s communication works like this. Also, how well does the X1Pro handle welding titanium?

Hi Chakufwa

The X1 Pro is our first consumer-grade product, and the majority of our customers are not professional engineers, which is why we have not yet opened up professional CNC cutting functionality. The reasons for not opening up the cutting feature are twofold: on one hand, there are technical challenges with laser cutting, and on the other hand, further optimization is needed to comply with global safety regulations. However, we place great importance on this feature.

Therefore, we provide interface control for the laser module. But this is a challenging task, and we are continuously working on optimization and upgrades, particularly to meet consumer demands in terms of machine performance, equipment cost, and safety. We aim to bring a device to market that is fully suited for various usage environments and has undergone extensive testing. This will take time, but we are constantly improving.

We also recognize that most of our customers do not have the same level of expertise as you. Therefore, we plan to enhance this functionality in future product iterations. Our device is equipped with an RS232 interface, and we are willing to provide the communication protocol to help you modify it on your own.

For titanium welding, it is a high-value process. Titanium has a melting point of 1670°C and a strength more than four times that of stainless steel, demanding extremely high precision, which is considered the pinnacle of the welding field.

Due to the tendency of titanium to become brittle during welding, which can weaken the weld strength, we recommend using 99.99% pure argon or helium as the shielding gas. Additionally, the weld must be cleaned before welding, and you can try using the laser cleaning function of the X1Pro to effectively prepare for welding. Proper heat treatment is also essential to achieve the desired metallurgical structure. Our Xlaserlab X1Pro has a power density of up to 10⁷ W/cm² and can generate over 700 joules of thermal energy per second. Welding titanium wire with a diameter of 1.6 mm or smaller is no problem at all.

If you have any questions, please feel free to contact us, we are happy to have an in-depth discussion with you!

How does your new laser welder compare to xTool’s? Their model seems much more professional, and their brand is also more established and trustworthy. I’ve purchased from xTool before, and their customer service and product quality are top-notch. Here’s the link to their new Kickstarter laser welder—it looks like they’re launching soon: https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/makeblock/xtool-metalfab-the-next-gen-metal-solution

Hi Dango

Thank you for your question. We noticed that many ideas from XTool are similar to our products. XTool is a well-known company that focuses on laser engraving and 3D printing products. They have launched many great products on Kickstarter, which we respect.

Our parent company, XPHOTONICS, focuses on laser technology. We have been doing this for 9 years, since 2017, developing all core technologies from laser chips to lasers and smart laser devices in-house. Our research and development team is highly capable. The lasers and designs in the Xlaserlab series are completely developed by our PhD team. We created the Xlaserlab series (including X1 and X1 Pro) as desktop-sized multifunctional laser welding machines. In our product development process, we found that many non-industrial users also wanted to try and learn laser welding. We focused on innovation and successfully integrated high-power laser welding technology into a portable design. After long-term testing, we verified its function and performance. We have also shared many real welding demonstration videos in our Facebook group.

In fact, X1 Pro and X1 are our third-generation handheld laser welding devices. But what’s very interesting is that we noticed that XTool’s current laser welding products are more like our first-generation products (you can check out our product demo video here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JwSSTJBcU4s). So we proudly say that both the X1 Pro fiber laser welding machine and the X1 semiconductor mini-pulse spot welder are different from XTool’s products in terms of positioning and have truly launched globally for the first time.

At the same time, we also noticed that many of XTool’s ideas are similar to ours, such as cleaning bicycle chains, underwater welding, and other application scenarios. It seems our thinking is quite aligned. :) We believe backers prefer original and innovative ideas.

We welcome all backers to share their thoughts and suggestions. We also hope you understand that our comment section is meant to maintain transparency in dialogue and follow community rules. We hope everyone will share honest and constructive feedback rather than mentioning other products or leaving advertisement links in the comments. This may be the reason your comment was reviewed.

If you’re interested, you can watch the advertisement for our first-generation product displayed in Times Square in New York, as well as our official promotional videos. Here are the related links:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6nesjbPfcA

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JwSSTJBcU4s

Once again, thank you for sharing your feedback and thoughts. We hope you’ll join us on this journey to make this amazing thing happen.

Thanks a lot for your response. I’m not trying to advertise any brand, I just want to understand the detailed comparison. I’ve bought plenty of DIY projects and Kickstarter hand tool projects, and I’m not affiliated with anyone. I’m simply interested in your project and would like to see how the specs differ between yours and Xtool’s. Can you help me go through the details?

HI Dango

Thank you for your explanation. We prefer to discuss based on each user’s needs, as welding involves very specific details. Could you let us know if you are mainly focused on portability, specific materials, or particular features? For example, are you planning to weld thin metals or more durable materials? This information will help us guide you in selecting the most suitable product.

Xlaserlab designs emphasize versatility and ease of use. The X1 is suitable for welding thin sheets (0.2mm-2mm) without the need for a wire feeder, while the X1 Pro can handle materials from 0.5mm to 3mm and can perform laser welding, cleaning, and cutting. Both machines are ideal for DIY enthusiasts, first-time laser welders, and professional welders. If you can share your main application scenario, we can provide you with a detailed explanation of our product's features and benefits.

Thank you

Will there be a dedicated head for CNC machines for the X1Pro ?

The pistol grip may be not optimal, a straight housing, controlled by computer may be a goal here (and to be honest a big need for me)

Even at consumer-level there are enough people that have a small cnc router at home (like myself).

Hi Sebastian, I second this, I have a small 4x4 foot cnc I built and also an 8x8 foot I built both for use with my plasma cutters but would be great if they make a straight "machine head" style gun to help keep them cuts exactly perpendicular because the standard gun shape don't help keeping the gun straight

Thanks @Xphotonics, this unfortunately is a reason to wait and not back this project (not enough money to get several machines tbh), if only a future machine will get such heads.

If it would be possible to have the heads interchangeable that would be a game changer in its own.

As you can see in the customer/prosumer part there are many with CNC :)

Hi David&Sebastian

You can design your own fixtures to secure the existing gun head and consider it as a solution. Currently, we don’t have plans to include a “machine head” style gun, but we are seriously evaluating the technical feasibility of this market demand. This may require a market feasibility study, and after the research, we will work to turn this idea into reality as soon as possible.

Thank you for your support!

Hello, the first question relates to submerged welding. To my understanding, long wave lengths do not really go well for under water. For such application short wave lengths, such as in the range of 380-500nm is prefered. Blue laser, for example transmits much better. Can you deliver the X1 Pro with short wave length sources? Next question is if hot wire can be accomplished. I read your delivering grafite liners? Would it be possible to heat the wire?

Last question is about the pumped capacity of the X1 Pro, I read this can temporary be driven up to 1200W. Can you elaborate on this feature? Thank you

Clear information, thank you. Personally I would not recommend long wave lengths for in water in static flow but only laminar flow, to remove bubble formation which can block laser transmission and recommend use of Osmotic water treatment to remove impurities. Ither than that I understand and agree on your comments regarding hot wire. It is not always needed but can control the laser energy transfer as less energy is required to melt the wire and as such the available energy for heating the melting zone. This reduces the risk of cracking such as is the case with COR-TEN steel and other alloys because it delocalizes tension accumulation. I will keep my bid in and hope to be able to test / purchase the Blue laser AM set-up. Pls keep me informed on that.

With that said, I still support and your using a very nice Diode from Coherent; which is great quality. Look forward to a succesful end of this Kickstarter project, good luck!

Thank you for your support! We are thrilled to have you join our journey!
