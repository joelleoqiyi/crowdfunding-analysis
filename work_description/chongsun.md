### Week 5:  
Created template to scrape links from kickstarter explore page. However, faced a challenge where everytime I tried to go to the next explore page, I would face cloudflare's "Are you human" checks, despite trying different ways (headless, using my own chrome profile).

### Week 6: 
Wrote code to scrape the comments from individual kickstarter pages. Managed to scrape 1-2 before getting hit with the cloudflare issue again.

### Week 7: 
Managed to get past the cloudflare issue thanks to Jeffrey's code. Scraped a 100 comment documents. The issue with the comments scraped however, was that the format was messy.

### Week 8:
Improved the comment scraping feature to be able to scrape the following:
User name, Comment date, Whether the commenter is the creator or not and the comment data. All this was put into a json file format. This marks the end of my scraping.

### Week 9:
