Please upload a video showing a 360 view around the projector while it is running and get those reviews done as soon as possible. I know I will be canceling if I do not see any progress soon.

Both Alex and saint are customers which at the end both are looking to use your technology and try to provide best advise for you, so don't be biased. Thanks",

As far as its use as a book scanner the 480 Mbps is more than enough to handle full size images faster than a person can switch pages. As far as its use for streaming, 480 Mbps is far faster than the recommended upload bitrate for any platform. USB 2.0 is not the problem. Changing to an port with a faster speed would not affect performance at all and would only serve to make some users feel better while increasing the cost. The change could also require changing chips on the board to ones that could handle the increased speed, which could also require redesigning the board to meet increased power needs.",

If USB-C were implemented in this model I think the USB 2.0 version would be more than adequate. If it were changed I imagine other users would complain since USB-A is still in wide use and may be the only unused USB ports on their device. Desktops still tend to have more USB-A ports than USB-C. Whichever connector is used there will be people requiring an adapter.",

The video format is MJPG, which is very high quality but isn't very suitable for streaming due to its large file size. It isn't compressed much so it requires little processing power to encode. Since the primary purpose is scanning books, I'm guessing they selected a processor well suited to that task. They do include an HDMI 1.4 port. For users who want a better streaming experience a good option would be using an HDMI capture device. That would let you get up to 4Kp30. The processing would be offloaded to the capture device or your computer without imposing a higher cost on all the users who just want to use it as a book scanner. If they find one that works well maybe it could be offered as an addon and they could get a bulk discount. Maybe it could be a stretch goal.",

With this feature, a serial interface via USB (more precise V-USB) cannot be implemented in the program anymore. However, users will have the chance to upload own programs directly over the ISP interface, that means without the Micronucleus bootloader. The PCB design of Doze offers free connection pads that can be directly connected to an ISP programmer (e.g. USBTinyISP). With this method, it should be possible to implement serial communication via USB in the program.",

You can power your 3D printer using a standard outlet if you're using a single unit, as the peak power is approximately 700W, with a typical working power of around 200-300W. However, if you are operating a farm or factory with multiple 3D printers running simultaneously, we recommend considering your electricity planning to ensure adequate power supply.",

With an FPGA, you can better learn how these protocols actually work. The Fipsy FPGA V2 allows you to design data structures like registers and wires for on-chip storage and processing, while controlling the GPIO.

            "comment": "That\u2019s a very good question! As you\u2019ve noted regarding heat loss, the actual capacity delivered to the phone from the battery will have some level of loss, with the typical conversion rate around 70%. However, depending on the circuit design, the thickness of the PCB copper traces, and the cross-sectional area of the wires, the conversion efficiency can vary. Of course, there are other factors that influence efficiency, so the conversion rate may differ. The rated capacity of Ivycable P6 is 3000mAh, which is its minimum capacity. Based on our actual tests, Ivycable P6 can fully charge an iPhone 12 Mini once. Since the standard capacity of the iPhone 12 Mini is 2227mAh, the conversion efficiency of Ivycable P6 can reach 74%, which is more than sufficient for a day\u2019s worth of outdoor backup power for the phone. Thank you very much for sharing such a professional question here, and once again, thank you for your support of Ivycable P6!",

The Nano Duo galvo laser can engrave photos on 4x4-inch slate or tile, but achieving engraving times under 1 minute\u2014especially around 30 seconds\u2014may be challenging, depending on the complexity of the image and the settings used. For hard materials like slate or tile, an infrared laser is preferred, as it provides better contrast and speed than diode lasers. If you have any other questions or need further guidance, feel free to reach out! Thank you for your support!",

Most people are going to be using audio over HDMI, or if using headphones, they're likely to be wireless, and if not, it's not that much bother to plug them into the computer. A second HDMI port would be massively more useful than an audio port. I hope that you will consider this if your designs aren't finalized. I'm willing to bet that myself and OP are far from the only ones who have no use at all for an additional headphone jack, but could definitely use more than a single HDMI out. Even making the second out DisplayPort would be acceptable (though HDMI would be preferred by myself).",

Please take this as intended, and that is I would really like to see you be successful and to do that you need to get your message out. People that I have mentioned this Kickstarter to have consistently said it looks really promising but there are not enough reviews. Personally I love the promise of this drive, I cancelled my pledge with another running Kickstarter campaign because I believe yours to be better for my intended uses, and that includes using my iPhone to capture ProRes video. A common drawback is the iPhone/external drive handshake is slow, which I hope you\u2019ve improved on. I would really like to see some stats on performance such as video recording performance and drive slowdown. Some others suffer with this as time and heat converge, and that typically results in a hit to performance, at least on an iPhone 16 Pro Max.",

Please if you would be so kind as to list any and all things that make them different? I do notice that you state that this one is 210W and the one on Indiegogo is 240W... Yet to me I do not see any (other) difference? I know that I am no specialist in Power Banks so this is one of the reasons I am asking for a little help in understanding the differences and possible pros & cons with each of the units? Your explanations will hopefully help me to make up my mind on witch one to Back, the one here on Kickstarter or the one on Indiegogo?",

From what I understand, it's supposed to ship in april, but where exactly is this coming from? Is it shipped from somewhere in the US, or is it coming all the way from china\uff1fIf it's from china, I'm a bit worried about the shipping. I mean, it's not cheap, and I want to make sure it gets here safe and sound. Do you guys have some kind of insurance or extra care for the transport?

On the other hand, because the X1 Pro uses a heat fusion principle during cleaning, the paint on the sheet metal carbonizes and releases a large amount of dust, which is more effective on the metal surface. This is a limitation based on materials. Some specific coatings, such as high-temperature cured oxide layers, are difficult to remove. The third limitation is the cleaning depth. If the corrosion is too deep, repeated cleaning or mechanical grinding may be needed during use.",
