        "content": "Dear Backers,\nThank you for your continued support and patience as we bring CyberBrick to life. Your enthusiasm and feedback mean the world to us. As we approach the end of the campaign, we‚Äôd like to share a few important updates:\n  ‚è≥ Shipping Delayed to May 15th\nOver the past few weeks, we‚Äôve gathered valuable feedback from early testing with creators. To deliver the best experience possible, we‚Äôre working hard to implement additional features and improve the reliability of both the Desktop and Mobile Apps. This also includes corresponding updates to the low-level firmware on the microcontrollers, which have resulted in delays in the production line.\n  As a result, we will need to postpone the shipping and software release to May 15th. We sincerely apologize for the delay, but we believe this extra time will allow us to provide a more polished and reliable product. Thank you for your patience and understanding.\n  We‚Äôll begin collecting your shipping addresses and other fulfillment information through a survey on April 15th.\n  üëï T-Shirt Memorial Gift for First 1,000 Backers\nPreviously, we have announced that backers who got one of the early birds will be gifted a free T-Shirt. However, we‚Äôve heard from many of you who missed the early bird tier due to timing or checkout issues, and we don‚Äôt want those people to feel left out. To show our appreciation, we‚Äôve decided to offer the commemorative CyberBrick T-shirt to the first 1,000 backers, not just early bird supporters. You can check your serial pledge number on your \"manage pledge\" page.\nWe‚Äôll be revealing the T-shirt design and sharing shipping details soon‚Äîstay tuned!\n  üá∫üá∏ U.S. Tariff Notice - We are standing with you!\nThe recent increase in U.S. import tariffs‚Äîcurrently up to 125%‚Äîhas significantly affected our cost estimates. As a Kickstarter campaign, we are more vulnerable to unexpected policy changes than traditional retail operations. This shift has taken both us, as creators, and many of you, our backers, by surprise.\n  That said, we want to stand with our backers during this uncertainty. We‚Äôve chosen to honor the original pledge prices and will ship to U.S. backers at the same rate as other regions. We're grateful that you‚Äôve joined us in exploring this new era of 3D-printable content through CyberBrick. \n  However, if tariffs continue to rise beyond the current levels, we may need to collect a portion of the additional cost in the future. If that happens, we will communicate transparently and in advance. Additionally, the future Maker's Supply retail price of these items will reflect the tariff.\n  To help offset the impact, we‚Äôve adjusted the add-on limit from +20 to +2 units per backer. This change will help us better manage shipping costs while still fulfilling our commitments. Existing pledges (The first 10,000 backers) are not being affected. New backers whose pledges exceed this limit will be contacted to make the changes.\n  Thank you for believing in CyberBrick and helping us shape its future. This is only the beginning‚Äîwe're excited to build what's next with you.\n  Warmly, \nThe CyberBrick Team",

It means a lot! Also‚Äîhuge thumbs up for the T-shirt idea! Even more so because my entire order is going straight to a primary school, where I run a 3D printing and robotics club. So every gadget (other than essential gear for our lab) will be used as rewards for our students. They‚Äôre going to love it. Wishing the CyberBrick team all the best!

Therefore, we‚Äôve decided to offer a T-shirt to the first 1,000 backers, not just early birds. üëï The T-shirt design and final reward details will be shared soon. üí¨ We also kindly ask everyone to respect each other's preferences when it comes to rewards. Whether you‚Äôre into practical gear, commemorative apparel, or digital content, all are valid ways to celebrate. Let‚Äôs keep the comments positive and welcoming! We‚Äôre planning even more rewards based on your feedback for the next big milestone ‚Äî Stay Tuned!",

But offer it in a different color than the first 1k version to preserve the prestige of the first 1k shirts. I think you all expanding to more than just the early bird backers is super cool, and even though I was already and early bird, I think its awesome. I vote a mousepad (Desk sized) of a schematic of the chipset and or an initial vehicle design. That or a maybe a themed screwdriver or toolkit. Totebag could be nice, but only if quality was enough for me to use it, but that can get pricey.",

Many of you have expressed the desire to get started with designing as soon as possible, so we‚Äôve quickly put together a set of foundational resources to help you dive in. This file package includes CAD models and basic specifications for all hardware modules, allowing you to at least begin your structural design work. We also encourage you to share these materials and invite more creators to join the CyberBrick community. Let‚Äôs build the future togetherÔºÅ\nSome part names or descriptions in these preview materials are subject to change. However, the dimensions and CAD models provided are accurate. We appreciate your understanding, as these resources have been released ahead of our original schedule.\nOn the other hand, our apps are still undergoing user testing and certification, so they won‚Äôt be available for a little while. However, rest assured that all hardware wiring and channel mappings are adjustable, so you won‚Äôt need to worry about making major design changes later. Thank you for your understanding!\nIf you have any questions about these materials or need additional information, please reply at the Bambu Lab forum post, and we‚Äôll respond as soon as possible. We also encourage you to exchange project ideas in the forum. You may find new inspirations from each other's projects, and avoid duplicate projects.\nFor questions about Kickstarter orders, pricing, and other related topics, please continue to interact in the Kickstarter comments section so that more people can benefit from the discussion.\nThank you for your support! Looking forward to your amazing projects!\nDownload the files here on Google Drive",

        "title": "Additional information on the Time-lapse Kit",
        "creator": "MakerWorld\nMarch 17, 2025",
        "date": "March 17, 2025",
        "content": "Dear Backers & Creators,\nThank you all for your incredible interest in CyberBrick!\nPreviously, we didn‚Äôt dive too deeply into the Time-lapse Kit to keep the focus on the RC-Toy as the central application example for CyberBrick. However, we‚Äôve noticed some confusion about its compatibility and functionality, so here‚Äôs a detailed explanation:\nWhich printers are compatible with the Time-lapse Kit? Do I need to purchase a cable to connect it to my printer?\nThe Time-lapse Kit supports both the A series and the X/P series printers. It can be connected to your printer using either the 4-Pin AMS cable or the 6-Pin AMS cable. If you‚Äôre using an AMS, you can connect the Time-lapse Module to the AMS instead of directly to the printer.\nIf you already have the cable that came with your AMS and don‚Äôt need the AMS while taking your desired time-lapse, simply unplug the cable from the AMS and connect it to the Time-lapse Module. If you need to use the AMS at the same time, you can purchase additional cables from the Bambu Lab Store.\nWhat cameras are compatible with the Time-lapse kit?\nThe Time-lapse module provides 3 ways to work with a camera or phone:\nBluetooth\nFor smartphones and cameras with Bluetooth function, the module can connect to them like any other Bluetooth peripheral device. The onboard button can initiate Bluetooth pairing and the LED indicates connection status and notify trigger release.\n  Cable\nIf your camera requires an external Shutter Release Cable, you can find one with an AUX 2.5mm connector to connect it to the Time-lapse module, like the ones shown below:\nServo (Mechanical)\nIf your camera supports neither of the above, you can also connect a servo to the Time-lapse module and mechanically press the shutter release button on your camera.\nWhat role do the mobile app and Bambu Studio play?\nThe Time-lapse can pair with Bluetooth devices by pressing its built-in button, and it has LED to indicate the connection status and notify shutter trigger. Only if you need to fine-tune certain parameters, such as servo rotation angle, then you can use the mobile app.\n\nThe Bambu Studio lets you set the time-lapse mode on your printer so it will park the tool head at the corner after each layer and send a triggering signal to the Time-lapse module.\n\nFor more details on how to use them please kindly wait for the user instruction later.\nIn what ways is it better than the built-in Time-lapse function on my printer?\nThe image quality of your choice of camera should be better than the built-in camera, and you have more freedom in terms of where to place the camera, what angle to point at your print, etc. \nWhat additional parts do I need for it to work?\nApart from the AMS cable mentioned above, if your camera does not support Bluetooth and requires a cable to trigger the shutter, you will need to source the AUX 2.5mm cable yourself based on the model and brand of your camera.\nIf I already chose a pledge without the Time-lapse kit, how can I add it?\nYou can click on \"modify\" on your pledge's page. If you choose one of the RC vehicles as the \"base\" pledge, you can add the Time-lapse kit as an add-on. \nDoes the pledge reward include the 3D-Printed case?\nNo, the physical 3D printed case for the Time-lapse kit is not included in the reward. Basically we're assuming that if you are trying to take a 3D Printing time lapse, you have a 3D printer at hand : )",
