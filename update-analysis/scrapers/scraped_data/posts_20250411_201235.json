If I were to add the protector, could I then put it in the zippered pouch, along with a USB-C cable for recharging when away from the dock? Also, would you be looking at a version that holds two (2) SSDs? That would allow users who have upgraded to higher capacity SSDs to make use of their older SSDs, rather than putting them in a drawer. Looking forward to this. All the other NAS systems seem to be rather complicated when all one wants is effectively a cloud drive but not in a cloud.",
