It means the world to me to see this campaign move forward well, and to receive so much meaningful engagement from synth lovers. This is as much about all of you, the future M0SS-101 community, as it is about the M0SS-101 itself.\nI noticed a few blog posts from Synthtopia, Gear News, and Sonic State. So if any of the authors are reading this, thank you! I loved reading your posts! Here are the URLs:\nhttps://www.gearnews.com/moss-101-synth/\nhttps://www.synthtopia.com/content/2025/05/13/new-moss-101-synth-fits-in-your-pocket/\nhttps://sonicstate.com/news/2025/05/14/kickstart-a-pocket-sized-synthesizer\nThere will be some stretch goal announcements, and some fresh demo videos in the coming days and weeks, so stay tuned, and once again, thank you ❤️\nAndrew",
