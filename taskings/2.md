## Tasking 2 (Complete by end of Midterms Week)

Exploratory Data Analysis 

### Taskings 

- chong sun: use the method jeff did to get around the kickstarter and scrap for the updates
- jeff: keep scrapping the comments
- alyssa and shi ying: keep getting the descriptions via openai and the basic information from the kickstarter 

anyone who is freer: look into scrapping comments or relevant kickstarter sentiment from twitter or whichever social media there is an api for

- All to present on Sunday: 
    * Look into some models for sentiment analysis and how we should deal with the descriptions of the kickstarter (keyword matching after determining which are the important keywords after exploratory
      data analysis?) and how these 2 can be merged together.
